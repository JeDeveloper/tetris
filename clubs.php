						Should robotics be a gender-segregated sport? Unlike in athletic sports, there are no substantial biological differences or potential awkward sceneries

						may someday become pregnant, or have ever been pregnant. If you begin shaking uncontrollably after drinking a Redbull, do not worry - this is perfectly
						normal. Talk to your doctor before disregarding his advice and taking Redbull anyway. If you accidentally take an overdose of Redbull, which the FDA
						defines as "Any at all", contact your local poison control center.
