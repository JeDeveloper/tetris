				Halfway through her first meeting with Donald Trump today, German chancellor and de facto leader of the free world Angela Merkel turned to Reince Priebus and said, "Okay, ha-ha, where's the real president?" According to reporters, Priebus hesitated for a moment before responding, "Madame chancellor, he's sitting right there next to you"<br/> 
				"No, that's a  model of a clown made by a capuchin monkey using paper mache and orange peels. It's not moving, and the sounds that it makes don't even sound human. This whole 'Trump' thing has been hilarious, but it's been fifty days. Bring out President Clinton or President Bush or President Cruz or whoever." <br/>
				According to witnesses, Priebus and Merkel were both silent for a few minutes, before Priebus nodded slightly and Merkel shouted at the top of her lungs "You gotta be fucking kidding me!"

				Speaking at a press conference today, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer firmly and unoquivically denied that Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is forming a private milita to do his will. "The Chief Strategist has no personal army in training. There is no such thing," Spicer told the assembled reporters while eating a stick of gum. "Bannon does not have some kind of personal gaurd practicing walking like a certain kind of waterfowl. There are not, at this very moment, trying on their new reddish-greenish upper-body-wear." Spicer paused to swallow his gum and pop another stick into his mouth. "So, to reiterate, Bannon has no private security force of young, angry men loyal to him personally. You can stop asking now!"
			</p>
			<p>
				Spicer then concluded the conferance without taking questions.

		<Title>Some Messages from Rockettopia Institute of Technology</Title>

		<Text>
			<p>
				The following is an official announcement from the administration of Rockettopia Institute of Technology:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					It's been a week since the start of spring semester classes, and we feel that some reminders are in order. We know that most students and faculty will already know most of this, but it's always important to remember and clarify various college rules and policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					First and foremost, Sigma Alpha Epsilon still has ninety-seven years left on the campus ban that was put in place following the Incident three years ago. Any SAE member found on campus <b>will</b> be arrested by CPS, and any student who knowingly brings or allows an SAE member onto campus <b>will</b> find themself in a disciplinary hearing. In a related reminder, students and faculty are forbidden from entering the enormous dome that covers the site of the old SAE House.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use of the particle accelerator as a room for sex is strictly forbidden between the hours of 8:00 PM and 6:00 AM, as well as during operating hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					The food at Gloria's is the best you're going to fucking get, so just fucking deal with it, okay? We're not a fucking restaurant.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Students - especially but not exclusively the engineering students - and are reminded that the use of Institute resources to construct giant death robots or doomsday weapons constitutes a misuse of resources and can result in academic suspension. Any students wishing to construct such things must do so on their own time with their own resources, or officially apply for a grant for a research project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under no circumstances is the biology lab to be used for growing magic mushrooms. We are aware that the First Wiccan Temple of Rockettopia pays very well for all magic items, but using Institute property for supernatural activities is against Institute policy and will result in a disciplinary hearing. In related news, the project to grow mind-control mushrooms is coming along quite well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Students and faculty are strongly discouraged from entering the swamps around campus. Not because there are any escaped lab specimens living in the swamps or anything like that, though. Nope. As our lawyers will tell you, there is no proof of escaped lab specimens occasionally devouring students who enter the swamp after dark. Still, management strongly advises that students avoid the swamp.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, it is our pleasure to introduce our new president, Dave! Dave is a veteran education administrator with a history of encouraging diversity and expanding engineering programs. He is eight feet tall, a three-time grammy-nominated rapper, and periodically cosplays as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Dave will become president of RIT in June, after the current president steps down. We invite you all to wish Dave the best!
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>4&#960; will rise</b>
				</p>

		<Title>Mexico to Build Wall, Make America Pay</Title>
		<Authors>

			<p>
				Mexican president Enrique Pe&#241;a Nieto announced in a press conferance today that, just as planned, his administration would build a wall along the American border and make America pay for it. "Ever since the Gringo with the orange skin and strange hair emerged, my administration has promised that we will build a Great Wall along the American border.", Pe&#241;a Nieto told the reporters in attendance. "Today, the American president-elect, Mr..." - Pe&#241;a Nieto glanced down at a slip of paper before continuing - "Fuckface tinyhands garbagefire von Clownstick Pussygrabber Drumpf called to update me on the progress of the Wall. He told me that he agreed, America would pay for the wall." There were audible cheers from the assembled crowd.
			</p>
			<p>
				"He called me, and he told me that America would pay to construct the wall along the U.S.-Mexico Border. I was very greatful, although we weren't giving him a choice. If he did not pay for our wall, we were going to stop making his clothing line. But still, very polite. He also said something about "reimbursement", and what sounded like 'We're going to win bigly. It'll be yuuuge, trememndous, believe me'. I am rather baffled by that, but I am still very glad that Mr. Pussygrabber has come around and will pay for our wall." Pe&#241;a Nieto was then met with more applause.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Now, more than ever, the wall will be nessecary to keep out the Americans coming into our country illegally. They're bringing fast food, they're bringing assault rifles, they're alt-right... and some, I assume, are good people. But still, it is good that they will pay for our wall."

		<Title>Rockettopia First Night Ice Sculpture Just Giant Turd</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				According to the Rockettopia First Night Board at the town common, this year's Rockettopia First Night ice sculpture has been designed to resemble human feces. The town sculpture - an annual First Night tradition - traditionally represents the overall year. For example, in 2015 the ice sculpture was a deflated football, in 2014 the sculpture was a double feature of an ISIS fighter and a missing malaysian airliner. In 2013, the ice sculpture was originally going to be an exploding pressure cooker, but was changed to Edward Snowden (pardon the pun) after that was determined to be "in terrible taste". In 2012, the ice sculpture was a deflated Mitt Romney.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, after fully considering what the year 2016 was and represents, and after subsequently spending two days in the mental health ward of the Mary Mallon Hospital, the members of the ice sculpture committee settled on modeling the sculpture off a literal piece of shit. "We considered Donald Trump, obviously, but then we thought about all the other things that happened this year., a committee member told News from Rockettopia. "The Flint Water Crisis, David Bowie, Brussels, Orlando, Alton Sterling, Brexit, Emails, Russian Hacks... And Harambe. Jesus christ, Harambe. It was a shitshow. At first, we considered making the sculpture a dumpster fire, but our sculptor told us he wasn't confident that he could make the flames look right. So we went with an enormous steaming pile of human shit. So we still kinda ended up doing Trump."
			</p>
			<p>
				Reactions to the sculpture have been mixed. Some residents appriciate the artist's perfect capture of the essence of the year we're leaving behind. Others said that it was 'inappropriate' and 'offensive', and pointed out that it might traumatize children under the age of fifteen who don't know what poop is. However, most people we spoke to appriciated the outside-the-box idea. "It represents the point to which the whole world has been moving this year", one man with a handlebar mustache and a hat told us. "It's a beautiful postmodern satire of our cynical culture of pessimism and effectively deconstructs society's idea of the human spirit. Fascinating!"
			</p>
			<p>
				We here at News from Rockettopia would like to officially state that we approve of the 2016 sculpture, and we sincerely hope we're still around to see the 2017 sculpture.

			<p>
				In a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">surprise press conference</a> today, Audacity College president John McDonald announced that the college would be undergoing some changes over winter break. "First of all, we're changing our name to 'Rockettopia Institute of Technology', the president told the a crowd of rather baffled reporters. "Also, we're increasing our student body size by a factor of ten, from 1,500 to 15,000. However, this isn't just transfers and new admissions; <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewNeighboursAsThePlotDemands">most of these new students will have already been here for a while</a>. As long as you don't think about it, it works." The president went on to say that <del>Audacity College</del> <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationNod">RIT</a> will be changing its focus from buisness, communication, and game studies to science, technology, and engineering, which will involve starting dozens of new classes that have been taught for years and hiring hundreds of new professors who already boast decades of experiance at RIT. The president concluded by announcing that he was changing his name to Will Dalton for no well-defined reason, and promising to continue the devotion to intelligence and quality that had defined Audacity College. Reporters responded by <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">asking what he meant by "Audacity College"</a>.

		<Title>Paul Ryan Responds to Trump Comments: "Everything's Going to be Fine, Reince. Step Away from the Edge"</Title>
		<Authors>

			<p>
				Earlier today, in some remarks regarding the actual, honest-to-god <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment">remarks made by Donald Trump suggesting that his rival Hillary Clinton should be assasinated</a> House Speaker Paul Ryan told witnesses, "Everything's going to be fine, Reince. Step away from the edge." Ryan continued, speaking from the roof of the Republican National Headquarters in Washington DC, "I know that right now it seems hard, but things will get better! Just trust me, take a few steps away from the edge, and we can go work this all out."
			</p>
			<p>
				"Look, Chairman Priebus, this has been hard on everyone. And I know that because a lot of people thought it was your job to deal with Tru-... the problem, they blame you. But they're wrong; it's <b>not your fault</b>. There's nothing you could have done. Now if you just agree not to do anything permenant, we can go downstairs and discuss this over ice cream."
			</p>
			<p>
				In response to a comment from a bystander stating that the situation was "Unsalvagable", "the end of the party", and "I can't live with this anymore!", Ryan stated that he felt the same way sometimes, and that just the other night while he was polishing his guns, he had thought about putting one in his mouth and ending it all, but he had kept going because the fight is not yet over. "Now if you'll take the gun away from your head, we can sort this all out... Yes, Reince, I know that guns don't kill people, but that doesn't mean you should point them at yourself. How about we call Phil Robertson? He always makes you feel better!"
			</p>
			<p>
				Following another bystander comment, Ryan stated "I know it's hard. I know that the pain feels like it will never end. But it will! This too shall pass. Think about your favorite person in the world. Yes, him! What would John Galt do in a situation like this? When the government tried to impose unjust restrictions on the makers of the world, and to stop him from completing his plan, did he give up? No, John Galt kept going, and he didn't let politicians or academics or laws or basic human morality stop him! You have to be like that! Things will get better, just step away from the edge, and trust your friend Paul."
			</p>
			<p>
				As of press time, Ryan was making promises that they would go together to see a friend and sort this whole thing out.

		<Title>During Acceptance Speech, Trump Reveals True Form to Delegates</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Donald Trump</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				During his acceptance speech last night, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump - a phrase that none of us seriously thought we'd ever have to write - briefly revealed his secret True Form to the GOP convention attendees. Trump began his speech by thanking the delegates - or "You poor, poor mortal lambs", as he put it - for giving him the nomination. "I said in a CNN town hall that as president, <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/trump-so-presidential-bored/">'I will be so presidential you won’t believe it'</a>.", Trump told the RNC. "That debate, by the way, got huge ratings because of me. Tremendous ratings. Ted Turner called me afterwards and said 'Thank you for the ratings, Donald'. He won't say so in public, but he did, believe me, he said it. I get the best ratings and everybody knows it. And even when I'm serious and presidential, I'll still get the best ratings. And I'll be so good at being president, you won't believe it. Like this."
			</p>
			<p>
				Trump was then surrounded by a cloud of glowing midnight-black smoke and what looked like a swarm of locusts that materialized from the convention stage. As the sound of a thousand voices chanting in a language older than time reverberated across the Quicken Loans Arena, every crucifix in the room shattered into thousands of tiny pieces. And given that this was the Republican National Convention, that was a lot of crosses. Labels reading "Trump" in gold sharpie appeared randomly on objects around the room, seemingly seared on by a tremendous heat. Then, without warning, the turbulent vortex surrounding Mr. Trump dispersed, swirling outward through the convention-goers and forcing them to cover their eyes. When they looked back, they beheld Trump's True Form.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two of Trump's assistants then dragged a bound, gagged, and naked Clinton staffer onto the stage and quickly scurried back. "Not great, she's only an eight, tops", Mr. Trump said in a voice like a volcano with a head cold, "but she'll do." Trump then began wrapping his hundreds of arms around the struggling Clinton campaigner until she was completely obscured by the nominee's writhing, leathery, tangerine-colored tentacles. For a moment, the reality show star turned politician's eyes glowed like blindingly shiny gold, before he released the lifeless, emaciated remains of his victim. "Tonight", Trump concluded by telling the awed delegation, "You have received a glimpse of what I will do to America!"
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, there is no footage of Trump's True Form, as all film exposed to it turned into frivolous court summons while the digital cameras recording Trump's speech just spit out text files containing only the words "Make America Great Again", written over and over.
			</p>
			<p>
				When asked if seeing Trump's true form had changed his mind about supporting the nominee, soon-to-be former House speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his stance that Hillary Clinton must be defeated at all costs. "Even if the streets must run red with blood and tanning spray. <b>AT ALL COSTS!</b>"

		<Title>Britain Leads America; "We Can Make Astonishingly Stupid Decisions Too!"</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Global</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				As America has barreled headlong into the most bizarre election in history - with two unlikable candidates, one of whom is... <a href="http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/blogs/550112/donald-trump-quotes.html">this...</a> - the people of the U.K took yesterday's 'Brexit' referendum as a chance to show that they too can make mindblowingly stupid decisions that fly in the face of logic. Britain, which narrowly voted to leave the EU, a move which - despite all common decency - the media insists on referring to as 'Brexit'. 'Brexit' is a portmanteau of 'Britain', referring to the U.K., and 'Exit', referring to the act of drunkenly running away screaming obscenities. Obviously, a better and more accurate term would have been a portmanteau of 'UK' and 'skedaddle'. But despite the best efforts of Wolf Blitzer, the term 'Ukedaddle' never really caught on, perhaps because it sounds less like a global financial catastrophe and more like a rooster playing country music. Which, we suppose, might actually be a substantially worse experience for those unfortunate enough to be nearby.
			</p>
			<p>
				But despite the massive potential economic and political fallout, 51% of Brits voted yesterday for Brexit (Ukedaddle?). But this was more than simply a display of thickheaded nationalism and xenophobia in the face of facts and reason - it was an attempt to show the world that the United States of America does not have a monopoly on making fantastically stupid decisions. "By nominating a racist mountebank reality show clown for their nation's highest office, those Yanks have really set a high bar for badly-informed and worse-thought-out decisions", a member of UKIP told News from Rockettopia. "But today we showed those buggers that they still have a lot to learn from old England! Now excuse me, dear chap, I've to go celebrate by snorting tea off the Union Jack!" While our... <i>enthusiastic</i> friend's use of the term 'England' instead of 'Britain' or 'The U.K' may seem incorrect (And we may seem very pedantic for saying so), it's actually correct, as Scotland overwhelmingly voted to stay in the EU, with Northern Ireland concurring by a smaller margin. The eventual nationwide vote to leave led many Scots to respond, "Vote to leave a union? Stoatn' idea, laddie!". If you have any idea what this means, please get in touch. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To make matters even worse for defenders of American exceptionalism when it comes to poor decision-making, after the resignation of British P.M. David Cameron, the new leader of the U.K. <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2016/06/boris_johnson_britains_donald.html">could be</a> former London mayor Boris Johnson, a man who imitates Donald Trump from <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-suggests-part-kenyan-obama-may-have-an-ancestral-dislike-of-britain-a6995826.html">racism and xenophobia</a> to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson/12200562/Boris-Johnson-I-was-mistaken-for-Donald-Trump.html">even the 'hair'style</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But unless America actually elects Donald J. Trump president - which for some crazy fucking reason is apparently a legitimate possibility and no longer just the world's most disappointing acid trip - the U.K. appears to pulled ahead when it comes to the voters making terrible, <b>terrible</b> decisions.

		<Title>Judge: "Let's Just Fucking Call It - Rich White People are Above the Law</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>College</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				In light of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/06/03/former-stanford-swimmer-gets-six-months-in-jail-for-sexual-assault-of-unconscious-woman/"> contravener surrounding the short sentance of Stanford University swimmer and rapist Brock Turner</a>, the case judge Aaron Persky replied with his thoughts on the case. What follows is his open letter:
				<blockquote>
					"On June 3rd, 2016, I sentanced convicted rapist and privlaged white male Brock Turner to six months in county jail. My arguement, which I made in my official opinion and will restate here, was that anything more than a slap on the wrist would have 'have a severe impact on him'. Some people since then have pointed out that - and here I'm paraphrasing - 'That's the fucking point'. But in saying this, they miss the overall point of my sentance. Brock Turner raped an unconcious woman in the belief that he - as a wealthy privlaged white male star athelete attending a prestigious university - would be effectively immune to any sort of consequences for his actions. A sentance longer than the token six months I gave him would have proven him wrong when, in fact, he was completely correct in his assumptions. Let's just fucking call it - rich white people are above the law.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					"Honestly, this should have been obvious after Ethan Couch. For those who don't remember, Ethan Couch was the rich white kid who got drunk and, while using a suspended license and going nearly twice the speed limit, killed four people. His rich parents hired a psychologist who testified that Couch believed that his wealth made him above the law, and who are we to tell him otherwise? Turns out that, just like Brock Turner, Couch was right - he got off with a few months in rehab and an order to stay away from alcohol. Then he was caught on video playing beer pong, fled to Mexico, was extridited back, and after all that still only got two years for killing four people. Still, after all that - I'd like to see a black person from the 'hood kill four people and pull that off! 
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					"So my point is, I had to give Brock Turner a short sentance. To do otherwise would have sent Americans the irresponsible message that rich white men have to follow laws too. And that's clearly no longer the case."
				</blockquote>

		<Title>Daenerys Targaryen Announces Plans to Conquer World by Walking Out of Fires</Title>

			<p>
				Following her spectacular emergence from a flaming meeting hall to astonish a crowd of new followers, Daenerys Targaryen, Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Queen of Mereen, 299 A.L. Biannual Vaes Dothrak Wet T-Shirt Contest Runner-Up, Fire Messiah, etc. announced her plan to conquer the world by walking out of bonfires. "The whole 'conquest' thing hasn't been working too great, what with Astapor and Yunkai being retaken by the masters and all," Targaryen told News from Rockettopia. "So I tried going back to the basics: walking naked and completely unscathed out of a towering inferno. And it worked again. Why should I go back to using weapons and armies?"
			</p>
			<p>
				The new plan, according to a document released by the Targaryen dynasty shortly after Daenerys' emergence from the flames, is to arrange for her to walk nude out of enormous raging fires everywhere she goes. "One well-placed fire in Kings Landing, one in Dorne, one in Lannisport, and one in Winterfell", the report said. The venues commissioned to be reduced to ashes have not yet been specified - nor has the fate of their current occupants *cough*Ramsay*cough* - but the Targaryen report did contain a brief note that "Past performances are a good indicator of future results."

		<Title>New RAs Inducted in Ancient Ceremony</Title>

				With great pomp and circumstance (As well as the song 'Pomp and Circumstance'), Audacity College director of Residential Life Paul Collins deputized the 2016-2017 academic year Residential Advisors, as is commanded by the ancient code. One by one, the new RAs were called up, ceremonially tossed a rag soaked in their own blood on the Eternal Flame, and were assigned their res hall by the Oracle. Each student waited with a combination of exhilaration and horror, knowing that two RAs were going to hear the dreaded words: Lyman Hall. After receiving their assignments, each RA knelt so that Director Collins could formally dub them 'Residential Advisor' with the ancient sword of Samuel de Champlain. With that, the new RAs each left without speaking to begin the day of silent meditation. For twenty-four hours, the new advisors can not eat, drink, speak, or sleep. Only after this period of solitary contemplation can they truly be called 'Residential Advisors', perpetrators of the ancient and arcane order dedicated to the protection of the residents of Audacity College.

		<Title>State of Indiana Wakes Up Morning After; Realizes with Horror What they Did Yesterday</Title>

				Residents of Indiana woke up this morning to the creeping, horrifying realization of what they had done last night. "He seemed so appealing!", Indiana resident Gloria Thomessen told News from Rockettopia. "But then, I woke up this morning with a psychotic, power-hungry mummified tangerine and thought 'what the hell did I do last night?'" Apparently, quite a few people agreed with Mrs.. Thomessen, as thousands of Indianans woke up with a similar feeling after getting together with the tall stranger with the expensive-looking toupee and the tiny hands.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I don't know why I didn't realize at the time," an unidentified Indianan said, "But he's so awful! And I gave him something I never should have!" As of press time, thousands of indianans are wondering if there's anything they can do to partially undo - or at least contain the horrifying damage that they had caused.

		<Title>Trump Plans to Crush Opposition in Indiana</Title>

		<Text>
			<p>
				As voters in Indiana go to the polls today to vote for the Republican nominee for president, GOP hopeful and joke that got <b>way</b> out of hand Donald Trump promised to "Crush all those foolish enough to stand against me!" Trump, speaking to a crowd of thousands in Indianapolis, announced that "After today, the pathetic insects who would contest my power will trouble my no longer! Even combined, Ted Cruz and that other guy cannot stand against my might! I <b>will</b> rule this country - all those who get in my way will be crushed under the juggernaut that is Trump!" The audience responded with a standing ovation and chants of "Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!" while foreboding music played as Mr.. Trump looked on with a satisfied smile.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past few days, Trump has gone all-out on Indiana in the hopes of clinching the GOP nomination. He has focused on appealing to the agricultural sector, which employs many people in Indiana. During campaign stops at local farms, Trump has made bold guarantees to Indianans, promising to "Water the fields with the blood of my enemies" and "Lead the American people like lambs to the slaughter". In a more normal Trump style, he at one point posed with an ear of corn and said, "Now this, this is tremendous American corn. Great corn. You know, I make the best corn. I even have a corn company, Trump corn, you should try it. And I love corn. I love the kernels, and the leafy stuff - all the corn stuff. And it can be used for so much! For example, my daughter could totally use this to masturbate. I'm not saying I think about that a lot, or that I'd want to watch, but you know, she totally could. It's amazing corn."

		<Title>Roose Bolton, Balon Greyjoy Dead of Fatal Convieniance Deficience</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Westeros</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort and King Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands both died this week of a fatal convenience deficiency. Greyjoy's death was a tragic accident: he fell from one of the bridges connecting the towers of Pyke. That is the official story according to the late king's brother and possible heir Euron Greyjoy. Euron Greyjoy has since returned to the Iron Islands suspiciously quickly after years in exile, and may have even arrived before his brother died. However, we have been told by high-placed sources that Euron's return and king Balon's sudden deaths are merely coincidental. We have also been told in gruesome and explicit detail exactly what will be done to our families should we suggest otherwise.
			</p>
			<p>
				But king Balon was far from the only powerful figure in Westeros to die of convenience this week - lord Roose Bolton has also tragically passed away. The North, which House Bolton recently acquired after <del>betraying</del> reconsidering their allegiance to the Starks of Winterfell, will now pass to lord Roose's son, Ramsay <del>Snow</del> Bolton. According to House Bolton press secretary Willam Karnoll, Lord Roose's last words to his son, shortly before he was murdered by his enemies, were "You will always be my firstborn." Anonymous sources have also reported that, shortly before his death, lord Bolton advised his son that "If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you'll be treated like a mad dog, taken out and slaughtered for pig feed.". We have also been informed in extremely graphic detail the fates of our families should we suggest that the late lord Roose was murdered by a close family member with a name beginning with 'R'.
			</p>
			<p>
				We at News from Rockettopia don't generally like to take sides in political fights, especially ones involving people who could have us murdered at a whim, but we have to say this much: House Bolton is much better at laying out the consequences of writing the wrong thing than House Greyjoy. The intern who read their letter - which was written in what we hope was red ink and signed with a sketch of a dead baby - is still recovering. We wish him the best.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those who have died this week. Our congratulations also go out to specific members of the families of those who have died this week.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Correction:</b> The letter we received from House Bolton detailing the sensation of being skinned alive was, in fact, written in black ink and signed normally. We seem to have confused it with the letter which we received from the Cruz campaign after we covered the <a href="http://www.rockettopia.com/article.php?article=tabloid_alleges_that_five_women_willing_to_bang_ted_cruz">brief sex scandal that involved Sen. Cruz</a>. News from Rockettopia apologizes for this error.

		<Title>Alistar Thorne Releases Statement: "Snow Never Told Me Not to Stab Him"</Title>
		<Authors>

		</Authors>
		<Topic>Westeros</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				Following his contravercial assasination of Night's Watch Lord Commander, Bastard of Winterfell, and very depressed person Jon Snow, Sir Alistar Thorne of the Night's Watch released a public statement on his motives. In his statement, delieverd by raven to all the major lords of Westeros, Thorne denied committing treason, saying "I have never committed treason. I have never disobeyed a direct order. Lord Commander Jon Snow never told me not to stab him." Thorne claimed that he "would have given his life for the Lord Commander, and followed his every order, but when he let the wildlings through, I really disagreed with him. So I got together with some other brothers, and stabbed him to death. There's technically no rule against it."
			</p>
			<p>
				Thorne then quoted the oath of the Night's Watch:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. <br/>
				I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. <br/>
				I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls.<br/>
				I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				"See?", Thorne wrote in his statement, "nothing about murdering the Lord Commander if we really want to!" Regarding the three brothers of the watch holed up in the Lord Commander's chamber with Snow's direwolf Ghost, Lord Davos Seaworth, and Lady Melisandre, Thorne wrote only, "There's nothing in the oath about killing them either."
			</p>
			<p>
				When reached for comment, Free Folk leader Tormund Giantsbane, who owes his life to the late Lord Commander Snow, glared and brandished his sword at our reporter.

		<Title>FEMA Dowses Rockettopia with Water after Plumes of Smoke Seen Rising from City</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				After multiple sightings of massive plumes of smoke from miles away, the US Fire Division (USFD), a subdivision of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), dispatched two dozen firefighting planes to douse Rockettopia in 100,000 liters of water in a desperate attempt to put out what they assumed to be an enormous raging fire. The plumes of smoke were six miles tall and visable from two states away, and appeared to be centered around public locations such as the town common, Audacity College, and University of Rockettopia's Redstone Green. The state government quickly ordered partial evacuations of multiple nearby towns after attempts to contact Rockettopia yielded only static and occational musings about how funny it is that, like, we have eyebrows. Like, what are eyebrows really for? Don't they look [giggle] silly?
			</p>
			<p>
				As of press time, the firefighting planes have been completely ineffectial at stopping the billowing smoke. The USFD has reportedly requested that the military use its orbital water cannons to assist in the firefighting efforts, to which the military has responded by shifting uncomfortably and saying that they certainly don't know what the USFD is talking about. What would they be doing with orbital water cannons? That would be silly, hahaha!
			</p>
			<p>
				We can only hope that tomorrow, Rockettopia emerges unscathed from what we assume by the smoke must be one of the largest fires in history.

		<Title>Snipers Patrol Audacity College to Ensure Students Stay In Line for Accepted Students Day</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			<p>
				Audacity College students were excited and upbeat today for accepted students day, when students who have been accepted for next year come to see whether this is a good school, or one of those boring ones that makes you take actual classes. The undergrads showing off the beautiful campus and fun student life were motivated by a love of their school, a desire to bring <del>fresh meat</del> new faces to campus for next year, and the three dozen snipers hidden around campus. The trained sharpshooters, hired from Rockettopia's own Pucewater Private Security, maintained a careful watch on students, ensuring that the everyday, just-for-fun frisbee games continued all day and that the study groups hanging out in the courtyard kept studying. Any visitor who noticed an unusual red dot on a student's head would be told that "It's just part of her religion! We're a very accepting and multicultural school!"
			</p>
			<p>
				Audacity is expected to return to its normal mix of gaming nerddom and pot-smoking tomorrow once the acceptees - and snipers - leave.

		<Title>Sean Penn to Interview Hero of Upcoming Film</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			<p>
				Renowned actor<sup><a href="https://xkcd.com/285/">[citation needed]</a></sup> Sean Penn announced today that, in preparation for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/07/dead-man-squawking-sean-penn-joining-angry-birds-movie">his</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/sep/23/the-angry-birds-movie-trailer-the-hottest-film-of-2012-is-coming">new upcoming movie</a> <i>Angry Birds</i>, he will continue his illustrious career in journalism by interviewing the hero who provided the inspiration for the film. The hero in question being, of course, Osama bin Laden. After being informed that bin Laden is dead, and has been for some time, Penn reportedly responded "That's what THEY want you to think!", and proceeded to begin interrogating a waterlogged corpse that he had been keeping in a crate. After a few days of bin Laden's corpse failing to respond to questions with anything other than a growing stink, Penn was forced to admit that bin Laden was either dead or very unintrested in answering questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Penn then travelled to Pakistan to interview bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri. However, Zawahiri refused to meet with Penn, citing the actor's record of destroying things that he was involved with. When asked if he was referring to Penn's interview with Joaquin 'el Chapo' Guzman, which <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mexican-president-el-chapo-re-arrested/">resulted in Guzman's arrest by Mexican authorities</a>, Zawahiri clarified that he had meant <i>The Gunman</i>, <i>Pauly Shore is Dead</i>, and <i>Gangster Squad</i>, but he supposes that the Guzman incident was bad too.
			</p>
			<p>
				In <i>Angry Birds</i>, an upcoming film that presents an <a href="https://www.quora.com/Are-the-Angry-Birds-terrorists">allegory for</a> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3037016/mobile/the-new-angry-birds-movie-whitewashes-a-depraved-history-of-existential-terrorism.html">the September 11th, 2001 attacks</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/3fdmjg/angry_birds_are_essentially_terroristsuicide/">from the perspective of the terrorists</a>, Penn <a href="http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/angry-birds-movie-sean-penn-is-grunting-terence/"> plays a large red bird named Terrance who basically just grunts angrily</a>. In the allegory, he probably represents either Saddam Hussein or Dick Cheney, but that's still unclear. Terrance may also just be Sean Penn being himself.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Angry Birds</i> stars Jason Sudekis, Josh Gad, and Danny McBride as the titular angry birds. When the birds are provoked by some fat, decadent pigs, they stage an all-out assault on the pig infrastructure using themselves as projectiles. In the game which inspired the film, the rage-fueled birds sacrifice themselves in sometimes-explosive suicide attacks, killing thousands of unarmed pigs. The pig leader's referance to 'nucular weapons' also strongly suggests a real-world analogy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Angry Birds</i> is scheduled to be released on May 20th, 2016.

		<Title>Review: The Brothers Grimm Spectactulathon</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>College</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Audaspians, Audacity College's unofficial acting group, held their first ever performance over the weekend. The play of choice was &lt;i&gt;The Brothers Grimm Spectaculathon&lt;/i&gt;, which, after much thought, our drama critic determined was a meta-narritive about a young, aspiring actor named Ollie who is desperately trying to pad his resume. In the story, Ollie is a very good actor, but because he doesn't have much experiance, he gets only a relatively small part in a well-performed but poorly written play: the titular &lt;i&gt;Brothers Grimm Spectaculathon&lt;/i&gt;. The play-within-a-play, which takes up the entire play, is a cheap knock-off of the wildly successful &lt;i&gt;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)&lt;/i&gt; full of broken dialouge and attempts to connect plots that should really have remained seperate. Also, there was something about 'crab people' who will definately never be mentioned again. The play was, on the whole, sickeningly family-friendly, somehow including no referances to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm047.html&quot;&gt;cannibalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm023.html&quot;&gt;talking sausages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm108.html&quot;&gt;human-hedgehog hybrids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=qr3BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=the+strange+feast&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d9VeAodyKC&amp;sig=LjZMaG6tBjv1pzu812TJ83FGdEo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK-YnVh4rMAhXBm4MKHdc3BLEQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20strange%20feast&amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;more&lt;/b&gt; talking sausages&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm110.html&quot;&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite the lack of nightmare fuel, the play still managed to be entertaining, thanks to a cast that included many excellant actors and also Steve Davies. In the end, all the other actors get sick from food poisoning and Ollie becomes the star, performing every role in the final act. But what became of the... &lt;b&gt;CRAB PEOPLE!&lt;/b&gt;

		<Title>Autism Speaks Changes Name to Autism Parents Yell</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Following Autism Awareness day yesterday, the global Autism &lt;del&gt;hate&lt;/del&gt; advocacy group Autism Speaks has finally acquisced to pressure and changed its name to 'Autism Parents Bitch'. Autism Speaks has &lt;a href=&quot;http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/10/fixing-the-charity-that-wants-to-fix-autism.html&quot;&gt;been widely criticized by actual autistic people for being a bunch of parents trying to 'fix' their children&lt;/a&gt;. To be fair, these criticisms are a completely accurate description of Autism Speaks, which is probably one of the few charities that seems to genuinely hate its &lt;del&gt;victims&lt;/del&gt; benificiaries. The most major instance of Autism Speaks taking flak was in 2009, when they &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1935959,00.html&quot;&gt;created a video entitled 'I Am Autism'&lt;/a&gt;, which looks less like a PSA than a cheap fearmongering youtube video produced by a eugenics group - which when I think about it is exactly what it is (They've since purged the video from the internet, so you'll have to take my word for it). Autism Speaks has also recieved &lt;del&gt;well-deserved loathing&lt;/del&gt; criticism for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2015/02/09/autism-speaks-vaccines/20040/&quot;&gt;early advocacy&lt;/a&gt; of the completely discredited &lt;del&gt;pile of festering horseshit&lt;/del&gt; idea that vaccines somehow cause autism, and the implicit suggestion that autism is a fate worse than death. Autism Speaks is also notable for not having a single actual autistic person on their board of directors. They did once have John Elder Robinson, the autistic author of &lt;i&gt;Look Me In the Eye&lt;/i&gt; and other books, but he &lt;a href=&quot;http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2013/11/i-resign-my-roles-at-autism-speaks.html&quot;&gt;resigned in 2013&lt;/a&gt; after realizing that he was helping to direct a hate group. Autism Speaks has been most widely criticized for their research into a 'cure' for autism, apparently not realizing that we already know how to remove a person's personality; it's called a lobotomy, and we stopped doing them for a reason.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				After all this, it almost makes sense that Autism Speaks has opted to change their name. &quot;We now recognize that actual autistic people have spoken, and they want us to shut the fuck up.&quot;, Autism Speaks founder Suzanne Wright told News from Rockettopia. &quot;It's time for us to agknowlege what we really are: a mob of parents who see our children as 'broken' and in need of 'fixing', rather than accepting who they are.&quot; Wright shrugged. &quot;If our kids were gay, we'd probably force them to undergo conversion therapy.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Autism Speaks has also released a statement that this epiphany will not in any way carry over to future articles about Autism Speaks.

		<Title>Audacity College Student Gov't Election Results</Title>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Student government elections were announced on Tuesday night in a candy-fueled extravaganza. We were unable to cover the story until now because we have been very busy, and also the town was locked down again after it was discovered that one of the peeps had survived. The presidency was won by Cathy McMurdo, a rising senior majoring in Networking and Cybersecurity. MrMurdo won by a sizable margin despite her opponent's claims that she was born in Raiderton and his promises to 'Build a wall and make Universiry of Rockettopia pay for it!' McMurdo was plagued by contraversey throughout her run, including questions about her stunning four-figure speaking fees from TherMouse and her insinuations that Sodexo food is actually edible. The campaign also survived a scandal in which MrMurdo's vice-president James LaRinne confessed to not smoking marijuana.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The class of 2019 elected Early Childhood Education major LaMari McSmithstein to the student government's senate for her promise to figure out what the student government does. McSmithstein has promised to learn if the student government has money, whether it makes rules, what it does with its money, whether it can legalize marijuana, where it gets its money, if it ever meets, and if it has money at all. She also promises to find out who the other student government senators are, assuming that there are senators other than her, which there might not be. Voters responded strongly to McSmithstein's promise of accountability, and elected her with an overwhelming 90% of the vote.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				There is also probably a secretary or something.

		<Title>Rockettopia on Lockdown after Peeps Escape U of R Lab</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				As of roughly ten hours ago, the entire town of Rockettopia, along with our neighbors Raiderton and the Grand Duchy of Lincoln-Sudbury is now on lockdown. We would have informed you earlier, but our Internet was knocked out and we were afraid to go out and try to fix it. When we did, we found that the wires were melted and covered with a disgusting sugary substance. We can only speculate, but we assume that this was due to a close call with one of the escaped peeps.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				According to reports by those researchers who survived the accident at the University of Rockettopia's Milton S. Hershey Food Science Lab, the peeps escaped the lab after somehow melting their way through two inches of solid steel, and subsequently surviving the five hundred million &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)&quot;&gt;Gy&lt;/a&gt; defensive measure. In less than fifteen seconds, the peeps managed to burrow through the five miles of rock between their underground holding area and the surface. Fortunately, one of the lab techs in the immediate area managed to survive enough to open a communications channel to the main office and let out a blood-curdling scream.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				As soon as the University faculty realized that the peeps had somehow escaped their containment unit, the mayor was contacted and a full lockdown of Rockettopia commenced. Citizens have been instructed to stay inside, lock all doors and windows, and avoid being visible to any peeps that might wander by their houses. The mayor took pains to stress that none of these safety precautions would do anything to slow down the peeps, but might make Rockettopians feel safer. &quot;Just like the TSA!&quot;, said the mayor.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				As of this writing, the lockdown is still in effect. Researchers at the University of Rockettopia, Audacity College, and elsewhere are currently working double-time in an attempt to contain the peep menace. The national guard was briefly called in, but has since fled in panic as they were melted alive by the terrifying marshmallow creatures. If you ever receive another update of News from Rockettopia, it means that we have somehow survived the peep crisis. If not, well...
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Good night, Rockettopia, good night.

		<Title>EXCLUSIVE: Cruz Love Letters Found; Written in Strange Cipher</Title>

				BREAKING: News from Rockettopia has just obtained these exclusive letters from alleged Ted Cruz mistress Amanda Carpenter. They were apparently found at the bottom of Ms. Carpenter's desk drawer. It's not breaking and entering if you're a reporter.... Right? We should probably get a lawyer.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Carter categorically denied the allegations on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unxhVVBuQ-M&quot;&gt;CNN friday morning&lt;/a&gt;, but despite this the scandal has continued to blossom throughout today. Cruz himself even held a press conference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjShCFlztV4&quot;&gt;deny the allegations&lt;/a&gt; and accused his rival Donald Trump of being behind them. The letters we obtained (Remember: That window was already broken when we got there) may provide hard proof of Cruz's illicit affairs. However, we won't know one way or the other unless we can translate the strange code that the letters are written in.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;img src=&quot;images/letter1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				&lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;We assume that thing at the bottom is a signature of some sort&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;img src=&quot;images/letter2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				&lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;What does it say? We can only guess&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Our best cryptographers are working double-time to crack the Cruz Cipher, but so far we have no luck. If any of our readers are cryptographers or know cryphographers, we encourage you to take a crack at decrypting the Cruz Cipher.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				More on this story, and the Cruz Sex Scandal, as it develops and grows to consume every bit of news on this blog.

			&lt;p&gt;
				According to a piece published yesterday in the tabloid &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/ted-cruz-sex-scandal-mistresses-cheating-claims/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ted Cruz has had no less than FIVE extramarital affairs while on the campaign trail.
			&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Today is a good day&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The magazine described
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;Private detectives are digging into at least five affairs Ted Cruz supposedly had,&quot; claimed a Washington insider.
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				(EEEEEE!!!!) [Breathe into a paper bag] Further investigation of released pixelated faces of Cruz's alleged mistresses found that they matched some... &lt;a href=&quot;http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/03/24/the-national-enquirer-runs-story-of-multiple-ted-cruz-affairs/&quot;&gt;surprising&lt;/a&gt; pictures. Specifically, Carly Fiorina's campaign manager, Donald Trump's spokeswoman, and a Cruz staffer. This lends more weight to the allegations, as a pro-Cruz superPAC had released FEC filings back in July showing that they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/31/why-did-a-ted-cruz-super-pac-donate-to-carly-fiorina/?postshare=9641458877974512&amp;tid=ss_tw-bottom&quot;&gt;gave half a million dollars to a pro-&lt;b&gt;Fiorina&lt;/b&gt; superPAC for unexplained reasons&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Cruz may have violated campaign finance law to pay off a political opponent. &lt;b&gt;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/03/24/the-national-enquirer-runs-story-of-multiple-ted-cruz-affairs/&quot;&gt;More evidence has been found to support the &lt;i&gt;Enquirer&lt;/i&gt;'s claims&lt;/a&gt;. A reporter for &lt;i&gt;Breitbart&lt;/i&gt; tweeted back in February,&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Been told it&amp;#39;s a few more days before we can drop the new Cruz goss. Nothing I can do :(&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Allum Bokhari (@LibertarianBlue) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LibertarianBlue/status/695321161413087234&quot;&gt;February 4, 2016&lt;/a&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
				When the scandal broke yesterday, he tweeted,
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I hate getting scooped.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Allum Bokhari (@LibertarianBlue) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LibertarianBlue/status/713246777231585280&quot;&gt;March 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;

			&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				But it's just an allegation. It might not be true &lt;b&gt;PLEASE JESUS CHRIST LET IT BE TRUE&lt;/b&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Perhaps the least believable thing about the #CruzSexScandal, as Twitter has oh-so-creatively dubbed it, is that five women would be willing to bang Ted Cruz. Are we really willing to believe that the most hated man in Washington - a man who looks like the love-child of Martin Shkreli and a garden gnome and is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gq.com/story/ted-cruz-loves-soup-zodiac-killer-maybe&quot;&gt;DEFINATELY the Zodiac Killer&lt;/a&gt; - was able to have FIVE extramarital affairs?
			&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;I guess so&lt;/i&gt;

		<Title>Trump Excited about New Tragedy to Exploit</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>Donald Trump</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Republican frontrunner and presidential hopeful Donald Trump is reportedly in a fit of ecstasy following another tragic terrorist attack for him to shamelessly exploit in his ongoing bid for power. &quot;Yess! My wishes have come true!&quot;, the billionaire and mange-ridden orangutan impersonator told a reporter from the Wall Street Journal earlier today. &quot;Paris was great - did tremendous good for my campaign! And now another Paris? This will give me a huuuge boost - you wouldn't believe it. And I'm the best at stoking fear and hatred, you know I'm the best.&quot; Trump has skyrocketed to the top of the GOP race despite - or perhaps because of - proposals to ban Muslims from entering the US, suggestion of a database of all Muslims in America, promises to bring back waterboarding and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/donald-trump-waterboarding-republican-debate-torture&quot;&gt;&quot;a hell of a lot worse&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and more. The attacks in Brussels earlier today are sure to give Trump even more material. &quot;This is the most tremendous, spectacular, thing that could happen!&quot;, Trump said. &quot;And with primaries literally today - even better! My results will be ten, fifteen, twenty points above polling because of this, you know they will. My results are the best. People love me.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Trump's hateful fearmongering threatens to eclipse the hateful fearmongering of other GOP candidates. Senator Ted Cruz in particular pre-empted Trump by immediately expressing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/03/ted-cruz-calls-patroling-muslim-neighborhoods&quot;&gt;need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Perhaps with this blatantly fascist and xenophobic statement, Cruz will finally succeed in topping Trump's exploitation of innocent deaths and secure his rule. But as Trump himself said, he is &quot;the best at stoking fear and hatred&quot;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				A few hours after his initial statements, the Trump campaign issued an official statement: &quot;Donald J. Trump expresses his great condolences to all those affected by this &lt;del&gt;godsend&lt;/del&gt; tragedy. In light of such acts of aggression against the West by all 1.2 billion Muslims, Mr. Trump will continue his &lt;del&gt;shameless exploitation of terror and tragedy in the service of naked personal ambition and megalomania regardless of the consequences&lt;/del&gt; efforts to keep &lt;del&gt;his future adoring subjects&lt;/del&gt; the American people safe from the threat of Islam.&quot;

		<Title>On St. Patrick's Day, Americans Celebrate Irish Contributions and Culture- No, Just Kidding, It's Booze</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>Culture</Topic>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Today on St. Patrick's day, millions of Americans took a moment to remember both St. Patrick and the numerous achievements of the Irish people- we're just shitting you it's booze. &lt;b&gt;Obviously&lt;/b&gt;. Americans celebrated St. Patrick's day by drinking copiously, drinking more, vomiting, incoherently hitting on shrubbery, and drinking. In other words, Americans did what we would probably do every day if it wasn't for basic social norms. Despite great prejudice, the Irish made great contributions to American industry, culture, and politics, which Americans celebrated today by knocking back a pint of Guinness while wearing green to celebrate their imaginary Irish roots.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/17/irish-americans-tired-offensive-st-patricks-day-me/?&quot;&gt;However, many Irish-Americans didn't share in the fun.&lt;/a&gt; The Ancient Order of Hibernians, which despite the name is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; an organization of bears that secretly the world, takes issue with the characterization of Irish culture on St. Patrick's day. The Ancient Order, which I refuse to believe isn't a front for the Freemason Illuminati Templars, has called for an end to products and advertisements that they see as antiquated and racist. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aoh.com/2016/03/11/amazons-st-patricks-day-merchandise-are-prime-examples-of-bigoted-stereotypes/&quot;&gt;We do not believe that Amazon would allow the sale of a product emblazoned with &quot;_____ TODAY HUNGOVER TOMORROW&quot; if that blank was filled in by any other ethnic group&lt;/a&gt;, the Order said in a press release, referring to multiple products that fucking exists. One of the less well-thought-out products bearing the intoxication-inducing quip is a large folding knife. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Irish-Hungover-Tomorrow-Manual-Opening/dp/B019CT226Y&quot;&gt;Seriously&lt;/a&gt;. Ancient Order chairman and suspected secret cabal leader Aidan O'Flannery told us, &quot;To be straight with ya, all this almost makes me wish for the days when we were starved, overworked, and denied jobs. That was nobly bearable, this be just humiliating. And would ye stop writin' me words with yer shitty fake accent!&quot;, he added, &quot;I'm speakin' to ye with me native Boston words!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Americans will have to get their drinking in quickly, because after this it's cold turkey. At least until Cinco de Mayo, when we celebrate Mexican culture with tacos, sombreros, guacamole, and drinking. Oops! Forgot Passover, where we presumably celebrate Jewish culture by drinking, wearing furry hats, braiding our hair, and probably hoarding money or something. It's almost as fun as  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockettopia.com/article.php?article=rhs_celebrates_mlk_day_and_cultural_proficiency_with_africanamericanthemed_day&quot;&gt;MLK day&lt;/a&gt;, where we all eat watermelon and fried chicken and listen to lots of gangsta rap!
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				And best of all is the Fourth of July, when we celebrate American culture, which is obviously what all of this really represents.&lt;br&gt;
				That and excruciatingly heavy-handed satire.

		<Title>With New ALICE Protocol, RHS Prepares for Inevitable School Shooting</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In preparation for the inevitable mass shooting that will soon strike Rockettopia High School, students at Rockettopia High School today were introduced to ALICE, a security protocol to ensure minimum deaths in the event of a mass shooting. &quot;Given the incredible academic stresses placed upon students at Rockettopia High and the loose gun laws in this country, it's a foregone conclusion that at some point, some kid will snap and open fire,&quot; the principal of RHS told us. &quot;When this does happen, we want everyone to be ready so that at most, half a dozen of our students die by the hand of a classmate.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alicetraining.com/&quot;&gt;ALICE&lt;/a&gt;, a program developed to cope with the all-too-common danger of a crazy person shooting up a school or workplace, consists of five steps. The first step, A for Alert, is to agknowlege that a student you might know and study with has gone berserk and now wants to kill you. Despite the hearing constantly on the news about such events, RHS students might have trouble internalizing the fact that it is happening &lt;b&gt;right now&lt;/b&gt; and that they are probably about to become a statistic, and then a talking point, and then a fading memory as next week a different mass shooting grabs the spotlight. The 'L' stands for lockdown - use furniture to barricade doors, because if our school is going to behave like a war zone, it might as well look like one too. More importantly. Containing the inevitable shooting is vital to minimizing the number of funerals that will soon be held in our shattered town. The 'I' stands for 'inform': Police, families, and EMTs should be informed about the shooting. They will probably be expecting it, because in this school half the students are already being pushed to mental breakdowns. It's actually kind of amazing that a mass shooting hasn't happened already. The 'C' stands for 'Counter'. Students were instructed to make noise and throw things at the shooter in order to reduce his ability to aim. After all, a thrown iPhone is a decent counter to an AR-15, right? Finally, the 'E' stands for 'Evacuate'. Technically, this means that in the event of a shooting, students should escape as quickly as possible. However, in practice this means leaving &lt;b&gt;right now&lt;/b&gt; and finding safety in a country where being shot at is not a predictable part of the education experience.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The NRA expressed a grudging approval of RHS' response plan. &quot;We created a national environment where 'being shot by a classmate having a psychotic breakdown' is a completely legitimate fear for a high-school student,&quot; NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told News from Rockettopia. &quot;Now it's time to deal with the consequences. The NRA would obviously prefer to arm all teachers, students, and class pets, but this is nonetheless a step in the right direction.&quot;

		<Title>Rubio Undergoes Ritual Purification in Preparation for Florida Primary</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				The morning of the much-anticipated Florida primary found senator Marco Rubio ritually preparing himself for the coming election. Rubio began by having his entire body scrubbed of all dirt and other contamination. The junior senator from Florida, now completely naked, was then then massaged with the seven sacred oils as incense burned around him. &quot;I am brave. I am strong. I accept my fate.&quot; the presidential candidate was heard to murmur as the nude vestal virgins braided is hair and covered his entire body with ritual oils. Rubio ended his purification by fully immersing himself in a sacred bath, which signifies that he is prepared for whatever may come on this election day.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Upon emerging from the bath, Rubio was met by a staffer, who reportedly said &quot;Your volunteers await, my noble senator.&quot; After a moment of contemplative silence, Rubio responded, &quot;Bring me my sword. I shall make an honorable end to this campaign.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
				&lt;img src=&quot;images/rubio_purification.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;i&gt;Senator Rubio contemplates the fickle nature of fate as he prepares for the Florida primary&lt;/i&gt;

		<Title>Rubio Campaign Digs in for Final Stand in Florida</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>2016</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Rubio campaign announced today that in plans to make its final stand against Drumpf in Sen. Rubio's home state of Florida. Florida, the campaign said, is a natural place for Rubio to make a last attempt to hold off the inevitable. Florida's long shape and swampy, floridian-filled terrian makes it an easy location to defend from the south. A Rubio spokesman explained, &quot;If Drumpf wants to take Florida, he'll have to start at the base and move slowly down the shaft to the tip at Miami, which as everyone knows is the really important part. Even if we get just the tip, we can still call ourselves satisfied. But if Drumpf and his posse want to take that away from us, they'll have to go through the whole wet, sticky wilderness, and we'll make them pay extra for every inch.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Rubio's campaign has certainly been putting horse behind their tough words. Yesterday, a pro-Rubio superPAC dynamited all the bridges in Jacksonville, &quot;to prevent Donald Drumpf's hoardes from crossing St. John's river&quot;, and the campaign has constructed extensive fortifications along Route 75. One particularly well-equipped barricade even reportedly includes an old soviet tank. (On an unrelated note, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockettopia.com/article.php?article=slavonistan_to_dedicate_troops_to_war_on_isis&quot;&gt;Rockettopia's old soviet tank&lt;/a&gt; is currently in shop for repairs, and is expected to return on March 16th)
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite the overwhelming odds, the Rubio campaign volunteers we spoke to seemed upbeat. &quot;I've spent my entire life looking for a cause like this,&quot; a twentysomething man holding a live alligator told News from Rockettopia. &quot;Rubio is young, he's energetic, he's resourceful he's- hold on a sec&quot;. The volunteer broke off for a moment and flung the alligator, hitting a peach-skinned, wig-wearing practice dummy right in the head. The volunteer pumped his fist, and returned to talking to us. &quot;As I said, Rubio is the only candidate who really appeals to me. Also, he's the only one to really dig into the issue of Drumpf's penis. I gotta keep practicing.&quot; The volunteer then grabbed another live alligator from the bucket by his feet and hurled it at another practice dummy.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In a week, Florida will vote for the republican nominee for president. Whatever happens, Rubio will hold on until the very end. &quot;There's nowhere else for me to run,&quot; the elf-lord and presidential candidate said as he sharpened a medieval longsword. &quot;If we lose here, there's no point in continuing. This is my home, and I will defend it to the last.&quot; Stirring music played as the candidate continued to inspire an empty auditorium with words describing his love for Florida, for Floridians, for alligators, for meth, and for bath salts. But can stirring music and well-thrown alligators save the Rubio campaign? Only next week's vote will tell.

			&lt;p&gt;
				Multiple eyewitness reports from yesterday have independantly reported Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus speaking to a group of shady figures in a dark Washington D.C. alleyway. Priebus, who was reportedly acting &quot;extremely distressed&quot;, reportedly showed the figures a photograph of some sort and told them, &quot;This guy has got to be stopped. Stop him at all costs and we'll make it worth your time. And make it look like an accident, will ya?&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				One of the shady figures, speaking with a heavy eastern-european accent, reportedly replied, &quot;Zat ees a person? To me zat looks more like a deformed potato covered in funny yellow mold.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Another man chimed in, &quot;Looks like mummified - how do you say? - orange. Vith dead grass on top.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&quot;Ees old voman vith bad hair dye.&quot;

				&quot;No! Ees unfortunate victim of multiple spraypaint accident!&quot; Eyewitnesses report that this remark was followed by the shady figures chuckling deeply to each other, while Priebus stood by awkwardly, eventually handing the men an unmarked envalope and walking quietly away.

		<Title>Americans Enjoy Last Day of Imagining Trump Not GOP Nominee</Title>

				With the Super Tuesday primaries coming up tomorrow and real estate mogul Donald Trump expected to win most of them, Americans are today enjoying their last day of imagining that Donald J. Trump will not be the Republican nominee for president. For the past few months, Americans have watched the eccentric joke candidate grow ever scarier and ever more plausible, even winning the last three primaries. With a 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/CNN-Poll-Donald-Trump-Hillary-Clinton-Democrats/2016/02/29/id/716582/&quot;&gt;new CNN poll showing Trump at 49%&lt;/a&gt;, Americans likely have only one more day of pretending that this racist prune covered in dead grass won't be an actual candidate in the general election. Americans are partying like there's no tomorrow, because after Super Tuesday, we will have to accept that there may not be. Attendance at entertainment venues from amusement parks to strip clubs are up by hundreds of percent as Americans take their last moments to enjoy the time before we nominated a ninety-year-old Martin Shkreli clone for America's highest office. We sent a reporter to the Boobie Bungalow, a local gentleman's club, to investigate the celebrations. He's been gone six hours and isn't back yet, but we've received texts from him reading,
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;Everythings crazy here. ppl are partying like the worlds ending. one of the girls told me thats b/c it is. then she gave me a lap dance and let me lick her tits. b/c trump is going to be the nominee so nothing matters anymore she said&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;Hey Chad get over to the boobie bungalow! My boss sent me to report on the massive party thats going on here! turns out they have free admission and free drinks b/c trumps about to be the nominee &amp; the world's gonna end!&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;srry disregard my prev text wrong #&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;now one of them is giving me a hanjob while im moterboating another! theyve really thrown away the rules b/c of trump! I AM NEVER LEAVING!&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;wer9tgjqe4kjth893&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Bars are expecting a similar uptake in attendance on Wednesday following Trump's anticipated win, as millions of Americans attempt to forget that our country is now a global laughingstock.

				Following his landslide win in Nevada, presidential candidate and Oompa-Loompa toupee model Donald Trump retreated to his penthouse suite in Trump Tower. Since then, passers-by have reported maniacal, almost inhuman laughter echoing from the skyscraper as thunder and lightning crashed around it. &quot;Muwahahahah! Today Nevada, tomorrow, &lt;b&gt;the world!&lt;/b&gt; Now I am &lt;b&gt;UNSTOPPABLE!&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, a deep voice reportedly boomed from the tower. &quot;Soon, America will be in my grasp!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When asked to elaborate, the overpowering voice responded, &quot;I will rule this country! All will fear the Donald! &lt;b&gt;Tremble in despair, puny mortals!&lt;/b&gt;&quot; as lightning struck the top of the tower, revealing a monstrous silhouette in the highest window.
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>Jeb Bush Checks Facebook to Find Worried Messages from Friends, Family</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Following a worrying tweet on Tuesday, presidential candidate Jeb Bush checked Facebook to find numerous concerned messages from friends and family. Jeb found that his wife, father, and few remaining friends had sent messages along the lines of &quot;Are you okay?&quot; and &quot;If you need to talk to someone, im there for u&quot;. The former governor has been in a bad place since being humiliated by real estate mogul and moldy prune impersonator Donald Trump in the Iowa Caucus. As Jeb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O74XDI-o7xc&quot;&gt;continues to flounder&lt;/a&gt; in the presidential race, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdCYMvaUcrA&quot;&gt;at one point actually begging an audience to applaud him&lt;/a&gt; his mental state has become more and more shaky, culminating in this tweet on Tuesday:
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p lang=&quot;und&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
					America. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TeduJkwQF3&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/TeduJkwQF3&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&amp;mdash; Jeb Bush (@JebBush)&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/699706718419345408&quot;&gt;February 16, 2016&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In hindsight, it's not surprising that Jeb is beginning to fall apart. Jeb has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/politics/jeb-bush-turtle-tortoise-joyful/&quot;&gt;described himself as a &quot;joyful tortoise&quot; and said that &quot;slow and steady wins the race&quot; while carrying around a &quot;pocket full of turtles&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Jeb is now so desperate that he has pulled out all the stops and let his half-price war criminal brother George open for him.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Jeb, if you need to talk to someone, you can always call us.

		<Title>Shepard Smith Stuck in Iowa Caucuses Time Loop Until He Experiences Epiphany</Title>

				Surprisingly, Jeb Bush might not be the person currently having the worst day in the world today; Shepard Smith has reportedly become stuck in an infinite time loop until he has a personal epiphany. According to the Fox News reporter, &quot;I've been living the same day over and over again for thousands of years! It's hell! I have to listen to Donald Trump give the same speech over and over and over again - at this point I could fucking recite it from memory.&quot; As our stunned reporter watched, frozen in horror, Smith then proceeded to do just that.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In an attempt to end the eternal agony of covering the Iowa Caucuses forever, Smith has reportedly tried a variety of tactics. He has thrown himself off buildings, shot himself, electrocuted himself, and even spoken to Ted Cruz. Most recently, Smith kidnapped presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, stole a truck, and drove it off a cliff into a gravel pit.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;images/iowacaucushuckabeegroundhog.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Okay, I'll admit it's not some of my best work&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				As of press time, Smith has decided to use his eternal time loop for some kind of good, and is now hiding near a Donald Trump rally holding a sniper rifle.

		<Title>'Bernie Bros' Already Composing Tirade About 'Rigged Election' for Reddit in case of Clinton Win</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				With the day of the Iowa Caucus approaching, the nation's so-called 'Bernie Bros' have reportedly awoken and are already composing their tirades, which they plan to post to reddit in case Hillary wins the caucus. Bernie Bro and GamerGate veteran Trey Stephens told News from Rockettopia, &quot;I spent breakfast trying to decide just how explicitly misogynist to make my rant. Should I just accuse her of playing the 'woman card'? Or should I go all-out and call her a bitch? I can't quite decide.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Another Bro was more certain about his views on Hillary's status as a women, but wasn't sure yet who to blame a potential Hillary win on. &quot;I'm trying to decide between Jews and Feminazis. I might also go for some gibberish about the PC Police,&quot; the man, who hadn't heard of Hillary Clinton until six months ago, told News from Rockettopia. &quot;I might just go with something generic about the 'establishment'.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When reached for comment, Sanders 2016 campaign manager Jeff Weaver told News from Rockettopia, &quot;Shit - they know the caucus is today? Hopefully they'll just rant about Hillary on the internet and not actually try to volunteer with the campaign. We &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; don't want to be seen in public with these assholes.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				As of press time, six rants about Hillary Clinton have been posted online on two different websites, and we have at News from Rockettopia have somehow already received roughly two dozen vaguely threatening emails from various neckbeards.

		<Title>Sticky Note Situation Ends with Stunning Events</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>College</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				As you all certainly now know, the strange events centering around mysterious sticky notes appear to have come to an end. The posters and sticky notes encouraging people to &quot;be yourself&quot; and &quot;live your dreams&quot; had been increasing in volume since last Wednesday, but the problem only became apparent on tuesday, as entire rooms were overrun by the slips of paper. The Build Your Own busness Lab was completely overrun that morning, leading the BYOB Lab to move to the Abstinence League headquarters, which has been abandoned for years. This led Campus Public Safety to ban students from entering the Abstinence League Headquarters, lest they encounter a busness manager. At this point, we dispatched one of our interns, Ellen Kalanski, to investigate the pamphlet.
			&lt;/p&gt;
				At this point, what we can say with certainty breaks down. We have found what appear to be Ellen's notes in among the ruins, but without Ellen herself, we can't confirm anything. This is what the notes say:
			&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				'Everyone else has fled the Student Life building, which is why I was so surprised to find the man who calls himself John Smith standing next to a strange machine, surrounded by walls covered with posters, flyers, sticky-notes, and adorable rubber ducks. &quot;This is your last chance! I don't want to do this! Stop multiplying; go back to just living alongside the humans, and I won't have to destroy you!&quot; At this point, Mr. Smith was hit in the head by a rubber duck, which didn't seem to affect him much, but it was followed by a wave of ducks which appeared to be leaping at him. Mr. Smith turned and shouted to me to run as he followed his own advice. As we fled, I looked back to see a flood of motivational slogans hot on our heels, but Mr. Smith pulled out a tool and pointed it at the ceiling, at which point a pipe burst and the posters were soaked. 'I'm the Doctor', he told me as we escaped.
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;What ARE those... things?&quot;, I ask the man who calls himself the Doctor.&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;They're called the Palakili. They're shape-shifting aliens that feed on self-esteem. You find them almost everywhere, but usually they lay low. They're symbiotes - they take a form that encourages people and feed off the excess positive energy. Since they can't live without their companion beings, they usually don't reproduce enough to become a real threat.&quot;
				Nothing too unusual about that. I had suspected that the posters were some kind of evil spirits like the ones that infected the writing implements last year, but his explanation made even more sense. &quot;But if the... Palakili don't reproduce enough to become a threat, what happened here?&quot;, I asked.&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;Usually. They &lt;b&gt;usually&lt;/b&gt; don't reproduce to become a threat. But here we have an out-of-control a colony; a tumor I would call it. It's like a cancer; usually some kind of instinct prevents them from multiplying self-destructively, but here, here something has gone &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, and they've forgotten to stop!&quot;
				&quot;Then what do we &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt;?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;There's only one thing to do: The corrupt colony has to be destroyed before it metastasizes and overruns your whole planet. In that room, I had a device that will drain their life-force, but I tried to negotiate with them instead of just destroying them. Now we're cut off from the machine, and it's out of range of my screwdriver!&quot; At this point, he held up his device. &quot;I need to find an amplifier of some kind. I could use the TARDIS, but the Palakili have us cut off from it too. Where around here can I find somewhere to amplify the signal? Think think think think &lt;b&gt;THINK&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;How about the computer lab?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;No, those don't have the hyperwave modulators that I need to adjust for amplification! If I rewire the microwaves in the kitchen with the artifacts in the unholy circle...&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				At this point, I was desperate, so I broke the most important rule. &quot;Well, we do have a certain... something else.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;If I reverse the wave frequency, then I can fashion a makeshift turbo encabulator, and... wait, what?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;I'm not supposed to tell aliens this - you're an alien, right? - but Audacity College has a...&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;A what?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;A secret lab where the Department of Alien Studies examines stolen alien technology.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
				&quot;Where did you get that?&quot;
				&quot;Probably from you, which is why we're not supposed to mention it to aliens!&quot;, I shouted to his retreating back. &quot;Maybe I should tell you where to find it!&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				There probably won't be time to write again after this. The Doctor rigged something up really quickly, but he says that if he activates the device, I might be killed or mentally traumatized. I told him that I've already seen a stand-up comedian at the Grind, and if that didn't traumatize me, nothing will. He is now telling me that I don't understand. He says that since the Palakili live off positivity, the only way he can kill them all is to drain all the positive energy from Audacity college. He says that it will only take a second for them to starve, but that anyone within the blast radius will experiance the worst mental trauma any being can experience: a feeling of total worthlessness. That's why he couldn't activate the device until now. I'm telling him that it's okay, and I'm not afraid to die to stop the tumor. He says it's worse than death; far worse. I told him that I already took Concepts of Self; I know crushing despair. He said it's worse. I said it can't be worse than that. Oh, he says, but it is. There's a button behind him that I think activates the device. I'm going to make a lunge for it. If I don't come back, tell my family I love them, and my boyfriend that if he even &lt;b&gt;touches&lt;/b&gt; that skank Kristen, death will not protect him from my fury.&lt;br&gt;
				Goodbye.
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				It is my pleasure and my sad duty to report that the 'palakili' are gone, now, along with this 'Doctor', Ellen, and the strange blue box that mysteriously appeared in the lounge last week. Anyone with knowledge of the whereabouts of the Doctor or Ellen should contact the Rockettopia Police Department's &quot;Alien Situations&quot; office.

		<Title>With One Week Until Iowa Caucus, Residents Advised to Stay Indoors, Bar Windows</Title>

				As the Iowa Caucus draws closer, the citizens of that state have been growing more and more concerned. With more and more candidates and campaign teams swarming into the state, the Department of Public Safety issued a report containing suggested safety precautions. These include
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Stay inside your house whenever possible&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Avoid town halls, public greens, and other public spaces&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you see someone wearing an American flag pin, turn and run as fast as possible&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If possible, avoid sharing roads with limousines&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you see a clump of strange yellow fur on top of what looks like an mummy covered in orange juice, shoot to kill&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you hear the phrase &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, quickly find a hiding place and do not come out of hiding until you can no longer hear the campaigners&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If a horned man with goat hooves calling himself &quot;Rick Santorum&quot; personally comes to your door and offers you riches beyond your wildest dreams in exchange for your &lt;del&gt;soul&lt;/del&gt; vote, do not sign any contract he gives you.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If you are unfortunate enough to be cornered by campaign volunteers, then we are sorry, but all you can do is hope that it will be over quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
				The Department of Public Safety concluded their message with the words, &quot;You are probably all going to die.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite the warnings, some residents have still been injured. A Des Moines man was admitted to a hospital after being severely mauled by Mike Huckabee, and a woman in Cedar Rapids tragically died after suffering a three-second exposure to Ted Cruz. Doctors refused to go into detail, but said that the woman, who walked within fifty meters of the Texas Senator, experianced over a thousand times the maximum safe exposure to Ted Cruz, and described her body as 'riddled with asshole-shaped tumors'.
			&lt;p&gt;
				To our readers who are unfortunate enough to be in Iowa, we at News from Rockettopia have this message: &quot;Run. Run while you still can. If you're already trapped, just focus on your own survival. We pray for your souls.&quot;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In local news, the strange, inspirational sticky notes have spread to the CCM building and to three residence halls. The other day, I walked by a bulletin board covered entirely by them, and I could have sworn I heard them rustling even though there was no breeze.

		<Title>Strange Sticky-Note Presence Grows around Audacity College</Title>

		<Topic>College</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Over the last few days, a series of strange, inexplicable sticky notes have been taking over Audacity College. The first one was spotted on a water bottle filling station in the student life center two days ago, and read &quot;Keep Calm and be Body Positive&quot;. Within a few hours, similar notes had appeared in a nearby girls' bathroom. They contain messages like &quot;Believe in Your Inner Power&quot; and &quot;Tough Odds just make Victory Sweeter&quot;. Yesterday, a dozen more notes were spotted throughout the student life center, and today there have been reports of inspirational quotes, some of them accompanied by images. After one note covered an important sign, a member of the maintenance staff attempted to remove it. According to what he has said since, when he reached to pull down the sticky note he was overcome with a feeling of positivity and self-appreciation. Pulling down the sticky note, he told us, would have been robbing people of the note's enlightening power.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				On an unrelated note, a strange man showed up on Wednesday. He wears a bow-tie, and a jacket. He has identified himself as John Smith, and when necessary has always been able to produce an ID, but nobody we spoke to had ever seen him before this week. Mr. Smith has shown a remarkable interest in the sticky-notes; according to one report, he was observed pointing a strange, whirring tool at one of them and murmuring &quot;what are you?&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				More on the strange sticky-notes and Mr. Smith as we learn more.

		<Title>In Wake of Celebrity Deaths, New Scientific Study Concludes All Humans Slowly Dying</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Following the tragic deaths of David Bowie, Alan Rickman, and that guy from the Eagles last week, a group of prominant scientits have published a paper saying that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuKB0_t3J0A&quot;&gt;all humans alive today are slowly dying&lt;/a&gt;. The paper, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, had over two dozen authors from across the country, in multiple fields. The researchers, with the help of many unsung grad students, sifted through mountains of population and demographic data from the entire history of the human race. Their conclusions from the historical records, coupled with findings from the cutting edge of medical science, led them to conclude that humans eventually die. &quot;The deaths of David Bowie, Alan Rickman, and that other dude may seem surprizing, shocking, or impossible to a normal person,&quot; Dr. Simone Diller of the University of Rockettopia told us, &quot;but actually, based on the data we currently have, it was entirely reasonable to predict that those people would eventually die. Sometimes, humans die before one would expect, and sometimes they die after one would expect, but they always eventually die.&quot; Seeing our looks of shock, Dr. Diller added, &quot;I'm sorry, I probably should have told you to sit down before I told you that.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When asked if there were any exceptions to the 'humans eventually die' rule, Dr. Diller told us that while they had no hard evidence, &quot;a growing number of researchers are taking a very close look at this man people call 'Kieth Richards'&quot;

		<Title>STDs 'Really Excited' for Resumption of College Life</Title>

				As college life is set to resume over the next few days, students and professors have been quivering with anticipation and terror, respectively. But no one, not even the local bartenders who are currently crouching behind barstool barracades with shotguns, are quite as excited as Rockettopia's new batch of STDs. Sexuallly transmitted diseases and infections from around the world, both returning veterans and new arrivals, are thrilled to return to the endless extravaganzas that are University of Rockettopia and Audacity College.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				One returning syphilis infection told News from Rockettopia, &quot;I'm really excited to be back! Last sememster I got to switch hosts fifteen times, and just before it was time to leave I ended up with this Sigma Alpha Epsilon brother. Back in Conneticut, I got to infect so many of his childhood friends - it was &lt;b&gt;such&lt;/b&gt; a blast. I can't wait to get back to school, though!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The excitement was not limited to returning diseases; newcomers showed just as much excitement, like this chlymidia we talked to. &quot;Until recently, my life was really boring; I was living on a koala who played a lot of D&amp;amp;D, so no action there. But then, one day, this guy comes along with this strange intrest in koalas, and long story short, here I am! All the other diseases on this guy have told me all about this 'University of Rockettopia' place, and I can't wait to experiance it for myself! There must be so many new koalas!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Some diseases will have to contend with students who may have acquired new immunities, but an HPV virus we spoke to didn't seem too concerned. &quot;Sure, some people will be vaccinated, but not many, and there's always danger in life,&quot; the virus told us. &quot;There will always be plenty of hosts to give cancer to.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Please fuck responsibly.

		<Title>Trump Rally Attended by Psychologists Attempting to Study the Mentally Deranged</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				A local Trump rally held in Rockettopia two nights ago had some unusual guests: A team of Psychologists from the University of Rockettopia. The team, which included two tenured professors, five associate professors, and fifteen grad students, reportedly came to study the behavior of the mentally deranged. They were accompanied by six sociologists studying the American electorate, four of whom have since been admitted to the Mary Mallon Hospital suffering from severe alcohol poisoning. We pray for a speedy recovery. Most of the psychological team made it through Trump's security, mostly by spouting racist gibberish and doing the Hitler salute, but two were turned away for looking &quot;too foreign&quot;. The police officers on duty refused the Trump campagin's demand that grad students Steve Gomez and Hassan Russert be imprisoned, and have also since been admitted to Mary Mallon Hospital for alcohol poisoning.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The remaining members of the team had the pleasure of watching the Donald speak, only occationally inturrupted by rational people pointing out that he is batshit crazy. Trump went on for hours about illegal immigrants, terrorists, illegal immigrant terrorists, inexplicably, laser velociraptors from Venus. Trump stopped occationally to suggest physical violence against those who dare speak out against him, but otherwise wasted no time on anything other than racist, lunatic vitriol. According to Dr. Richard Morris, the Trump &quot;Seems to have an oddly personal vendetta against anyone who does not resemble himself both physically and ideologically.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				But what the team from U of R were really intrested was the Trump supporters. &quot;Trump may be lying to gain support from these people - that's what politicians do,&quot; associate professor Dianne Swann told us. &quot;But these people who go to his rallies are completely genuine.&quot; After sorting through a few dozen morbidly curious liberals and horrified moderates, the team finally got to talk to a genuine Trump voter, who identified himself only as Jim the Toolshed. According to Jim, &quot;Those furreners  are coming and taking over our country, and Trump's the only man who can stop us. Look at us: Our president's a Muzlum, our vice-president's also a Muzlum, our congress is filled with Muzlum, the supreme court is all Muzlum, even our military as full of them! You're probably Muzlum too! Wait, am I a Muzlum? What if &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;'m a Muzlum! How can I tell?&quot; At this point, Jim the Toolshed hoisted an AR-15, and the team felt compelled to retreat. The professors told News from Rockettopia that it was against their policy to comment on such specific psychological cases, but the students had no such compunctions. Annie Swift, who is now writing her Ph.D thesis on those with a deep disconnect with reality, told us that Jim the Toolshed appeared to have &quot;A screw loose&quot;. Her friend Mark Miller chimed in and called Jim &quot;Unhinged&quot;. At this point Nate Jensen added his two cents, that Jim was &quot;Not the sharpest knife in the drawer,&quot; to which Annie responded that Jim had seemed like &quot;A plank short of an outhouse&quot;, to which Mark replied that Annie was &quot;Trying too hard with that last pun&quot;, leading Annie to tell Mark that he &quot;Certainly hadn't been trying too hard last night,&quot; at which point Nate and our reporter exchanged looks and quietly left as Mark and Annie continued to bicker. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Other subjects were also interviewed by the U of R team, and were described by Dr. Morris as &quot;Generally the kind of people I find in padded rooms making dolls out of their own hair.&quot; One man was convinced that his cat was a meexican ISIS agent and had implanted a chip in his brain. Another seemed to believe that the Department of Transportation was monitering her every move. Still another simply spouted something about &quot;the negro&quot;, and wandered off to accuse a tree of being an illegal immigrant. The aforementioned Ph.D student Annie Swift called them &quot;excellant material&quot;. It was, by all accounts, quite a night.

		<Title>Audacity College White Student Union Opens, Impressively Boasts Zero Swastikas</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Over the past week, over thirty colleges have seen outbreaks of so-called 'White Student Unions'. This trend began at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and has since spread to dozens of colleges across America. As of today, that list includes our very own Audacity College. No one is sure if this trend is a response to #BlackLivesMatter, the Syrian refugee crisis, or simply an ongoing trend toward racial equality, but privileged white millennials certainly seem to be losing their shit. &quot;It's outrageous that when blacks found a student union, they're 'civil rights activists', but when whites found one, we're 'racists'&quot;, one of the roughly four dozen Matts at Audacity told News from Rockettopia. &quot;It's time to take our country back! But not like that. You know what I mean.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ChamplainCollegeWhiteStudentUnion/&quot;&gt;Audacity College White Student Union&lt;/a&gt; was founded earlier today, has so far accumulated an impressive five likes, and an even more impressive zero swastikas. As of this time, no cross burnings have been planned, but we at News from Rockettopia can't promise anything on that front. We will continue to provide updates until this page is taken down twenty-four hours from now.

		<Title>Following Paris Attacks, Nation's Lawmakers Suggest Policies Modelled off Japanese Internment, Nuremburg Laws</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				In the wake of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 129 people and injured hundreds more, American lawmakers have proposed new laws to combat the threat of displaced civilian refugees. Many of these laws, such as those proposed by presidental candadite and self-described human being Donald Trump and Roanoke mayor Dan Bowers. Bowers, in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://theslot.jezebel.com/roanoke-mayor-bravely-inspired-by-japanese-internment-c-1743361352&quot;&gt;official statement released yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, requested the suspension of Syrian refugees being resettled in Roanoke. In his letter, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://theslot.jezebel.com/roanoke-mayor-bravely-inspired-by-japanese-internment-c-1743361352&quot;&gt;cited the Japanese Internment program during WWII&lt;/a&gt;, saying &quot;I'm reminded that President Franklin D. Roosevelt felt compelled to sequester Japanese foreign nationals after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and it appears that the threat of harm to America from Isis now is just as real and serious as that from our enemies then.&quot; This proud chapter in American history, in which we sent hundreds of thousands of American citizens to concentration camps on grounds of race, presents a good model for the treatment of refugees.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Perhaps inspired by Bowers' brave stance on refugees, evil reanimated mummy wearing a sea sponge and GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/19/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-threat-to-country/index.html&quot;&gt;proposed new measures to surveil American muslims&lt;/a&gt;. These measures, which include surveillance of mosques, warrentless searches of muslim homes, and potentially, requiring muslims to carry ID at all time. These measures have been called 'unthinkable' - by Trump himself. Although unlike mayor Bowers, Trump has not cited any inspirations for his policies. However, many of them appear to resemble the Nuremberg Laws instituted in 1935 by Nazi Germany, which definately didn't culminate in any kind of massive, unimaginably crimes against humanity.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, even those more moderate than Trump and Bowers have solutions with roots in history. The blocking of refugees from Syria harkens back to the &lt;i&gt;St. Louis&lt;/i&gt; affair in 1939. The &lt;i&gt;SS St. Louis&lt;/i&gt;, a ship full of Jewish refugees from Germany attempted to dock in Florida. However, the US government, perhaps out of fear of a wave of refugees, refused the Jews entrance to the States and sent them back to Germany. We can only assume that they lived happily ever after, as no one ever regretted sending a shipload of Jewish refugees back to Nazi Germany. Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.her.ie/life/new-documents-reveal-anne-frank-was-denied-a-us-visa/265589&quot;&gt;documents strongly suggest that&lt;/a&gt; Anne Frank was deinied a refugee visa in 1941. Despite this, she lived a long and happy life; her uplifting diary is still read in schools today. Yes, that's totally what happened. Just go with it.

		<Title>Yale Faculty Contravercially Refuse To Tell Students What To Do</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Faculty at Yale University are recieving a heated backlash and pressure to resign after expressing the contravercial position that elderly, out-of-touch people should not be telling snake people what to do. In an email to students at Sillimans College, a college in Yale University which she supervises, Early Childhood Education lecturer Erika Christakis told students that it was not her place to issue specific guidelines on what halloween costumes are appropriate, and that as mature adults, the students are able to make informed choices for themselves. In her email, the former preschool teacher courted contraversey by refusing to treat college students like preschoolers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefire.org/email-from-erika-christakis-dressing-yourselves-email-to-silliman-college-yale-students-on-halloween-costumes/&quot;&gt;&quot;I don't, actually, trust myself to foist my Halloweenish standards and motives on others.&quot;, Christakis said in her email. &quot;[...]Whose business is it to control the forms of costumes of young people? It's not mine, I know that.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In the days since, Mrs. Christakis and her husband Nicholas have been attacked, sometimes literally, by hoardes of students apparently demanding that adults exert more control over their lives. A particularly spectacular example occurred when Mr. Christakis was &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9IEFD_JVYd0&quot;&gt;yelled at and cursed at by a mob of enraged students.&lt;/a&gt; We at News from Rockettopia assume that the Christakis' have been constantly thinking &quot;I can't believe this is happening. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SDGyPRr9-AE&quot;&gt;I'm surrounded by idiots.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; over the past week, but it's possible that they are somehow above that.  Certainly, Mr. Chistakis' tweet in response to the video, in which he says, &quot;No one, especially no students exercising right to speech, should be judged just on basis of short video clip.&quot;, suggests so.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/11/09/students-protest-buckley-talk/&quot;&gt;Tensions only escelated&lt;/a&gt; after, in a private conferance about free speech, author Greg Lukianoff said, &quot;Looking at the reaction to Erika Christakis's email, you would have thought someone wiped out an entire Indian village.&quot; The remark quickly found its way onto social media and when they left the conferance, attendees were met by hundreds of students and chants of &quot;genocide is not a joke&quot;. Apparently, the students failed to realize that Lukianoff's statement wasn't so much a joke as a completely accurate description of the events of the preceeding week. The crowd was held back by Yale police but hurled insults at the conferance attendees and spat on them (I wish I was making this shit up). One minority attendee was called a 'traitor'.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				None of this is in any way to discount actual racial issues that still pervade America, even at an institution so aggressively multicultural as the 72% &amp;amp;lt; white Yale University.
				According to one report from a week ago, which is actually AFTER this whole mess got started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/02/students-accuse-yale-sae-fraternity-brothers-of-having-a-white-girls-only-policy-at-their-party/&quot;&gt;minority students attempting to attend a frat party were barred from entrance and told that the party was 'white girls only'&lt;/a&gt; The fraternity in question? Sigma Alpha Epsilon, because of course it was, they're awful. (On the other hand, the bouncer was arguably doing the minority girls a favor, as SAE is notorious for its rape culture.) Maybe the student groups should be doing something about this instead of swearing at faculty who dare treat them like responsible adults. Just an idea.
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>American Public Torn Between Hatred of Rape, Kesha</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				As 'music' star Kesha put forward an impassioned plea to be allowed to record music without here accused-rapist producer Dr. Luke, the American people were torn between their hatred of rape and their hatred of Kesha. This comes after months of public litigation and accusations between Kesha, her producer and noted slimeball Lucasz 'Dr. Luke' Gottwald, and Sony Records, which I am proud to say I had zero knowlege of until ten minutes ago. Since filing a lawsuit in October of last year claiming that Gottwald had repeatedly sexually assaulted her during their ten-year collaberation, and Gottwald's subsequent countersuit alleging defamation, the 'singer' and her producer have been embroiled in legal hell. Over that time, Kesha has been unable to sing, tour, or sell merchandise, which she worries will &lt;del&gt;rehabilitate&lt;/del&gt; damage her reputation. In a release two days ago, Kesha(or rather, her lawyers) said that if she could not resume recording soon, her career would be 'effectively over', leading to conflicting emotions among the American public. &quot;On one hand&quot;, some random guy on the street told News from Rockettopia, &quot;what has been done to Kesha is awful, and if these allegations are true, she has been horribly mistreated. On the other hand, if this is a chance to prevent Kesha from ever releasing another record, well, as they say, 'Don't look a gift horse in the mouth'.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Other random people on the street had similar internal conflicts over the Kesha-Luke issue. Hating Dr. Luke, we were told, is easy; any english-speaker who spells his name 'Lukasz' and goes by the title 'Dr. Luke' is unbearable just on those grounds alone. However, sympathizing with Kesha is proving to be much more difficult. On one hand, we were told, she claims she experianced ten years of sexual assault. On the other hand, this is the person who shoveled atrocities such as &lt;i&gt;My First Kiss&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dinosaur&lt;/i&gt;, and (this is true)&lt;i&gt;Blah Blah Blah&lt;/i&gt; onto the world. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite this, Kesha continues to talk about how this legal fight could end her career, apparently unaware that this is viewed by the American people not as a potential catastrophe but as a bribe. If Kesha really wanted to get the American public on her side, she could simply arrange for all music stations to play nothing but her music in solidarity. &lt;b&gt;That&lt;/b&gt; would resolve her case in only hours.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, there was nearly-univeral agreement that no matter how aggregious Kesha's crimes, after a few minutes of soul-searching, the American people would stand behind her. There was also a universal agreement that we never, ever, &lt;b&gt;ever&lt;/b&gt; want to face this choice with Nikki fucking Minaj.

		<Title>Rockettopia Makes Frantic Final Halloween Preparations</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				With All Hallows' Eve once again right around the corner, the town of Rockettopia spent the last week frantically completing the final preparations. Many of the precautions were in response to the catastrophe that unfolded last Halloween. For example, an extra row of electrified barricades have been placed on College Street to provide increased defense for the downtown district. All alcohol in Rockettopia will also be moved to a secure vault under town hall, which everyone agrees is something we really should have thought of years ago. The vault will be guarded by members of the city council in person; unfortunately, this will probably be very boring, but I'm sure they will find something to do.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Existing safety precautions have also been stepped up a notch. The entrenchments surrounding the eastern residential districts will be guarded by an elite force of police fusiliers in addition to the usual neighborhood watch troops. The police have also supplied two tear gas howitzers, although these will hopefully not be necessary. In addition, the evacuation of all residents of the college district has been changed from a 'suggestion' to an 'order' following numerous deaths in previous years. City Hall has also issued temporary home insurance to any and all citizens living near University of Rockettopia, although some critics have argued that anyone owning real estate in such an obviously hazardous area deserves whatever comes to them.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, by far the most extreme defensive positions are around the First Wiccan Temple of Rockettopia. Barbed wire, three SWAT teams, land mines, some new 'toys' from the RHS Robotics Club, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockettopia.com/article.php?article=slavonistan_to_dedicate_troops_to_war_on_isis&quot;&gt;the tank that usually guards the border with Raiderton&lt;/a&gt;. Citizens not involved in the defense are strongly encouraged not to go near, look at, or think about the Wiccan Temple during halloween.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				If all else fails, citizens are urged to take shelter at the community farm at the old nuclear missile silo, or in the Forbidden Dog Park right next door. (The city council would like us to remind you that dogs, dog owners, and dog lovers are welcome at the Forbidden Dog Park from dawn till dusk all year long. Plans to change the name are still in the works.) From there, we will attempt to hold out until extraction.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The one place in town that has not been secured is the ancient hippie burial ground, as nothing too bad has ever really happened there. Yes, every halloween the hippie ghosts rise and play guitars at locals, but this is relatively harmless and no excuse for acts of aggression. True, shooting the hippie ghosts will not harm them, but it hurts their feelings, and everyone knows that ghosts are very sensitive. The hippie ghosts will also encourage trick-or-treaters to take up drugs, but this is an important life experiance for any child.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Finally, a few words of advice from the writers here at NR:
				&lt;ul style=&quot;text-indent:0in;&quot;&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMa0DZBNoKY&quot;&gt;The likelihood of children being drugged or poisoned by Halloween candy is essentially zero&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, kids should be instructed to watch out for more realistic dangers such as cars, supernatural entities, dire coyotes, republican campaign operatives, and people giving out organic gluten-free all-natural non-GMO candy.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						If, God forbid, you see a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon who may have slipped through the perimeter, &lt;b&gt;do not attempt to capture him yourself&lt;/b&gt;. Instead, call the Fratboy Control hotline and wait for the professionals at Fratboy Control to come and take him to the local fratboy shelter.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						It is important to be able to distinguish between dangerous demonic possession and normal, responsible demonic possession. Be sure to consult the brochure on possession that was sent to all citizens earlier this week for details.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						If your children do not return from trick-or-treating by four in the morning, ground them. You have to set limits and enforce them, or else your children might grow up to be libertarians. I know it's hard to hear, but this is important for everyone.
					&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>Nation Startled that Democrats Taking Election Seriously</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>2016</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Yesterday, Americans viewing CNN discovered, to their surprise, that the Democratic Party is apparently taking this whole 'election' thing pretty seriously. Those viewers who did not immediately move on after realizing that Donald Trump was not going to appear were subjected to two hours of meaningful debate about the issues facing America, rather than rambling, shouting, and personal attacks. Viewers described being &quot;shocked and horrified&quot; when presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said of the scandal dogging his opponent Hillary Clinton, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/oct/13/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-emails-video&quot;&gt;&quot;The American People are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails! [...] Enough of the emails, lets talk about the real issues facing America!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Sanders has apparently failed to realize that a good politician attacks his opponents using overblown scandals, rather than defending said opponents. By the end of the debate, the few brave viewers who had stuck all the way through said, variously, that &quot;It was just a dare from my friend!&quot;, &quot;Jim Webb is my uncle&quot;, &quot;Lincoln Chaffee is &lt;b&gt;my&lt;/b&gt; uncle!&quot;, &quot;I fell asleep&quot;, &quot;I never gave up hope that Donald Trump would somehow end up on stage&quot;, and &quot;I was tied to a table&quot;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although the outcome of the debate in regards to polling is unclear, Lincoln Chaffee has already seen his support base grow from &quot;imaginary&quot; to &quot;very, very small&quot;. Jim Webb, by contrast, has had to fend off conspiracy theorists who claim that he is the same person as South Carolina senator and Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham. Supporters of the theory point out that the two candidate look similar, have both served as southern senators, are both vaguely racist, have somewhat similar positions, poll at similar levels, and have never been seen together. (Okay, there is at least one clearly doctored photograph and one fake video of them together, but that's not the point!) The growing crowd of believers call the theory 'Jimsey' and tweet with the #JimseyTruth. Neither candidate has yet responded to their tweets.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Regardless of the fate of Graham/Webb's candidacy, the debate signals the start of the real democratic race, which will probably be very boring unless Lincoln Chaffee demands that his polling numbers be measured in metric.
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>PAUSE Club Controversially Questions Holiday Honoring Mass Murderer</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				On Columbus day this year, Audacity College's PAUSE club, which I assume stands for something, held a small rally with the controversial theme that a five hundred year old mass murderer should not be honored with a national holiday. The group set up a display of local Native American culture and also, for some reason, covered a statue of a different explorer with copies of the academic honesty policy with the word 'PLAGERISM' written on them. But their most controversial proposition was that perhaps it was time to retire a holiday honoring a clueless, genocidal psychopath who was lucky enough to discover a land that had already been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Erikson#Discovering_Vinland&quot;&gt;discovered at least once before, five hundred years prior to his arrival&lt;/a&gt;. Others have pointed out that it's kind of weird to say that this maniac 'discovered' anywhere, considering that there were already people living in the places he 'discovered', who he proceeded to massacre.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In an interview with News from Rockettopia, the leader of the PAUSE club said of Columbus, &quot;This is a man who misjudged the side of the earth by a factor of roughly four. This is a man who would have killed every person on his expiditon had he not luckily run into some islands. This is a man who's first thoughts upon encountering the friendly, welcoming people of the Bahamas was 'they would make good slaves'. This is a man who later did just that, and ended up wiping out an &lt;b&gt;entire ethnic group&lt;/b&gt;. This is a man who was so cruel, that the Spainish - the fucking &lt;b&gt;SPAINISH&lt;/b&gt; - arrested him for his crimes against the natives! Perhaps we shouldn't be revering this guy &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; so much?&quot; Many people across the United States appear to agree, and today has seen numerous instances of vandalism of Columbus statues, most notably one in Detroit which took an axe to the head.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, this attitude is not universally accepted. Most notably, a few decades ago, noted &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; columnist Jeff Jacoby claimed that, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeffjacoby.com/8044/christopher-columbus-hero&quot;&gt;I am not fucking with you here&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;[Columbus] was also the man who sowed the seeds of Western civilization in the New World -- a world that until then had known little more than superstition, slavery, and savagery.&quot; and &quot;Only the culture that made possible an Age of Exploration could make possible 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.'&quot;, lines which somehow did not result in Jacoby being fired from the &lt;i&gt;Globe&lt;/i&gt; for racism. In fact, he still is somehow allowed to write a &lt;i&gt;Globe&lt;/i&gt; column to this day. As a sidenote, Columbus day was originally established to celebrate Italian-American heritage in 1792; Columbus presumably having been chosen because more ethically sound Italians such as Benito Mussolini had not yet arrived. Perhaps next year will see the end of Columbus day, but let's face it: So long as they get their iPhones, cheap gasoline, assault rifles, and Big Macs, Americans don't give a shit.

		<Title>Following Air Strike on Hospital, DoD asks "Why Do People Care Now"</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Global</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Following a US airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan that killed nearly two dozen people, the Department of Defense expressed puzzlement about the resulting outrage. In a press conferance earlier today, US General and man has one week &lt;b&gt;tops&lt;/b&gt; left at his job John Cambell wondered why now, of all times, the public would care about the routine massacres of civilians by the United States overseas. &quot;We've been indiscriminately bombing countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and more for years. Why have people suddenly started to care?&quot;, the general asked. &quot;And why, dear god, did it have to happen under MY watch?&quot; Cambell raises a good point. America has been bombing countries like this, originally with manned aircraft and then more recently with unmanned drones, for years. &quot;Back in 2013, we bombed a WEDDING CONVOY in Yemen. Yemen, a country that we aren't at war with and that most Americans can't even locate on a map! And no one gave a shit!&quot;, Cambell pointed out. &quot;So why the fuss over this new atrocity?&quot; Cambell declined to point out that later that same year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/07/21/us-bombs-great-barrier-reef/2572225/&quot;&gt;American jets accidentally bombed the Great Barrier Reef during a training exercise&lt;/a&gt;. The bombs were unarmed, no damage was done, and it's totally irrelevant to the point, but we thought you really should know that.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Later, in a press conferance in front of the White House, President Obama expressed sadness for the loss of innocent lives stemming from the attack. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of this tragic attack that we ourselves conducted. The American people can rest assured that a mistake of this magnitude will not happen again. The next time that your tax dollars are used to kill children in a foreign country, it will be by drone strike, as is the proper method for comitting atrocities. Given the public's attitude on our civilian massacres, I'm sure that will make everything okay.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				An official in the Department of Defense, who did not wish to be named, stood up to defend America's overseas operations. &quot;People will say after this that we're just like the Taliban, that we also kill civilians, blah blah blah blah blah. Bullshit! The Taliban target civilians for murder; we don't give a shit one way or another, we just kill everyone. On the flip side, the Taliban only kill civilians who are in some way opposed to them. Again, we don't waste time figuring out who our strikes hit. We just kill, kill, kill and apologize later. Not like the goody-two-shoes doctors can complain anyway; they're fucking corpses now.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When asked for comment, Republican presidential candidate Jeb! Bush said simply, &quot;Stuff happens&quot;, while his fellow candidate Donald Trump let loose a stream of incoherant, racist gibberish. Reporters are unsure of he was responding to the question or simply talking as usual.

		<Title>Wiccan Temple of Rockettopia Definitely Not Connected to Strange Noises; Screams During Eclipse</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In a statement issued today, the First Wiccan Temple of Rockettopia denied any connection to the strange noises and screams heard during the lunar eclipse earlier this week. In a statement today, the Temple,s president Raven Luna Caderyn said, &quot;The indescribable noises, piercing shrieks, and occasional moans of pleasure that were heard coming from the town forest had nothing to do with us. We are a normal, non-sacrificy religion that does not engage in blood-orgies in the name of the goddess. Who said anything about blood-orgies? I didn't say anything about blood-orgies. What's a blood-orgy?&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In the weeks leading up to the supermoon eclipse, which had not happened for thirty-three years and will not happen again for another eighteen years, many in town had speculated that the Wiccans would hold a special festival to signify this rare astronomical event. These suspicions were strengthened by the mass adoption of dozens of stray puppies from the local animal shelter, all of whom had the rare DEA 1.1+ blood type. Concerned about the potential for town-wide disaster, and remembering the apocalyptic scene following the 2012 'Transit of Venus Ritual Incident', the town banned the Temple from conducting any ritual that could potentially result in damage to the fabric of reality. However, after lawsuit and bomb threats from the ACLU, the Council was forced to lower their ban to merely a 'discouragement'.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Wiccan Temple, for their part, has denied that the supermoon eclipse has any spiritual significance. &quot;The eclipse of the moon is of no importance to the Wiccan faith. We do not believe that it signals an ascension of the god Morrigan, signifying an era of blood lasting until the next eclipse. No one is saying that.&quot; Following this denial, Caderyn continued, &quot;In fact, I hadn't even heard about the eclipse! I don't even know what an eclipse is! Or a moon, for that matter! What's a moon? Is it like the sun, but at night? Is that it?&quot; Ms. Caderyn refused to take questions from the press.

		<Title>For Lunar Eclipse, U of R Students Point Telescopes Skyward For Once</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In a present deviation from their usual activities, University of Rockettopia students reportedly used their numerous telescopes to actually look at the sky last weekend. According to sources, the U of R astronomy club actually used the telescopes in their sorority-adjacent observatory to observe the rare supermoon eclipse, instead of whatever it is they usually do with their battery of high-end observational equipment. The reports indicate that the students spent nearly half an hour looking through the telescopes at the eerily red moon before resuming whatever it is they usually do with their telescopes on Sunday nights.

		<Title>Campus Eerily Quiet as Students Hide from Parents</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				The campus of Audacity College was oddly quiet tonight as the freshman students tried desperately to hide from their parents. Parents began arriving for parent weekend at 4:00 PM, and students quickly began concealing themselves everywhere they could. As parents wandered around campus, asking each other why it could be that their little angels would not text them back, students hid in their rooms, their friends rooms, their enemies rooms, their classrooms, and conveniently-placed trash cans. This strange state of affairs is expected to occur from 6AM to 11PM throughout parent weekend.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				An update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Weeping_Angel&quot;&gt;Weeping Angels&lt;/a&gt;: After an angry mob stormed the Department of Alien Sciences office earlier today, the DAS was forced to admit that actually, they had just been drinking, smoking weed, and hooking up for the past week as they waited for the Doctor to show up and save everyone. When asked why they had not been working on actually attacking the angels, the DAS quoted the Doctor as saying that &quot;you can't kill a stone&quot;. The Mining Club responded &quot;Oh really?&quot;, grabbed their picks, and ran into Lyman shouting cries of war. The observers along the perimeter say that they heard a few minutes of yells and the sounds of crumbling stone before a stone head broke through an upper window and landed in a native-plant flowerbed. Residents were able to move back in only hours later; they say that the hall is still quite livable despite the layer of gravel that now covers the floor. According to one resident, &quot;It's still more fit for human habitation than Bankus.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				And that wraps up Spirit Week! Next week we will return to our normal schedule of barely posting anything.

		<Title>CPS Sweeps Bankus Hall for Drugs; "This is totally going to work" says Chief</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Just hours ago, Audacity College Campus Public Safety, or CPS, performed a surprise sweep of Bankus hall, looking for hidden alcohol, drugs, other drugs, still more drugs, and also alcohol. According to CPS chief Hank Mann, &quot;This is totally going to work. We are going to go through Bankus Hall, find all the drugs that are there, and there will never be a drug problem at Bankus again.&quot; As of the time of this writing, Bankus Hall once again reeks of pot.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				An update on the ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Weeping_Angel&quot;&gt;Weeping Angel&lt;/a&gt; crisis. The Angels are still contained in Lyman, but according to reports, the Department of Alien Studies is hard at work brainstorming solutions to the Angel problem. This has been confirmed by repeated paper airplanes that have flown out of the Alien Studies office, along with giggling and puffs of smoke. We at News from Rockettopia are getting somewhat impatient with the AS Department's glacial pace in dealing with the Weeping Angel issue.

		<Title>Uneventful Wednesday a Welcome Relief During Spirit Week</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Students at Audacity College in Rockettopia were relieved as Wednesday failed to bring any sort of additional chaos or destruction upon their campus. &quot;The Weeping Angels are still occupying Lyman, and that's a little scary&quot;, an anonymous student told News from Rockettopia. &quot;But overall, it was kind of a relief.&quot; Some unusual events did take place, such as when a Disney-themed karaoke event was halted half way through by Disney lawyers threatening lawsuits, or when the tinker bell mason jar decorating event devolved into chaos after drunk Sigma Alpha Epsilon members showed up and shoved the jars into their anuses, but all in all, it was a quiet day.

		<Title>Amid Controversy, Pres. McDonald Cancels "Politically Incorrect" Disney Caricature Event</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>College</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Following  protests and condemnation, Audacity College's president Johnathan McDonald canceled Spirit Week's &quot;Disney Caricature&quot; event today. The plan was to have volunteer student artists draw caricatures of interested students in the fireside lounge, but the event drew the ire of professors claiming to represent the princess community. Calling the event &quot;Cultural appropriation&quot; and &quot;Blackface in tiara form&quot;, the outraged faculty demanded that president cancel the caricature event, which he did. We attempted to contact various famous princesses from around the world, but of those who responded to our emails, not a single one had heard of Audacity College or objected in any way to the caricature event. According to Kate Middleton, the event &quot;sounds like a lot of fun&quot; and the cancellation was &quot;quite silly&quot;. When confronted with this evidence, the protesting faculty called Middleton the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dolezal&quot;&gt;Rachel Dolezal&lt;/a&gt; of princesses&quot; and pointed out that she was born a commoner and is still actually not a princess at all but the 'Duchess of Cambridge'. They then called for Middleton to retract her &quot;politically incorrect&quot; statement and resign from something, although no one's yet figured out what. The rest of Spirit Week is scheduled to continue as planned.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In a big victory for Audacity today, the ghosts who yesterday rose from the dead and demanded to be given control of the college for Spirit Week have agreed to return to their graves. This came after a night of tense negotiations, which were resolved when the ghosts agreed to leave this mortal coil in exchange for certain unspecified concessions. In related news, a live demonstration of the life of Calvin Coolidge, who was apparently a US President and was married in Rockettopia, will be taking place on Saturday at Coolidge House. A spokesman for the Audacity College administration told reporters that the mass arrival of students wielding proton packs was unrelated to the ghost treaty.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The &lt;a href=&quot;http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Weeping_Angel&quot;&gt;Weeping Angels&lt;/a&gt; have been contained to Lyman Hall by a round-the-clock vigil of watchers. Good job, watchers, keep it up! And remember, &lt;b&gt;DON'T BLINK&lt;/b&gt;. A long-term solution to the angel situation is currently in the works, but in the mean time, any students who still need to fulfill the community service portion of the LEAD requirement are encouraged to report to Lyman Hall to assist in the containment. All students will also be required to attend an Alien Life-Form Safety seminar at some point over the next week.

		<Title>Audacity College Survives First Day of Spirit Week</Title>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Against all expectations, Audacity College seems to have survived the first day of Spirit Week. It is possible that I am speaking prematurely, since as of this writing there are still a few minutes left of Monday, but with the Angels contained, the ghosts currently in negotiations, and only two remaining beavers, it seems safe to assume that Audacity has made it through Monday with no fatalities.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The festivities began to go wrong when the beavers that were released at breakfast turned out to be rabid. In hindsight, the Audacity College department of School Spirit has said that perhaps they should not have purchased discount beavers from that guy on a streetcorner who said they had fallen off a truck. Three dozen students have recieved rabies shots and are currently recovering in Rockettopia's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_Mary&quot;&gt;Mary Mallon&lt;/a&gt; Hospital.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Audacity College President Johnathan McDonald would like us to not speak in depth about the ghosts while negotiations are still in progress, except to reiterate that the dead's misinterpretation of spirit week is being viewed as a harmless mistake and that Bill Murray is currently on standby if negotiations fail.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, the real disaster came during stoop decorating, when the residents of Lyman Hall decided to celebrate the season premiere of &lt;i&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/i&gt; by decorating their Res Hall with imagery from the show. Apparently, the residents of Lyman knew just enough &lt;i&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/i&gt; lore to make incredibly accurate statues of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Weeping_Angel&quot;&gt;Weeping Angels&lt;/a&gt;, but did not know enough to know that you should &lt;b&gt;NEVER EVER DO THIS&lt;/b&gt;. President McDonald has released a statement saying that Audacity's Department of Alien Studies is looking into a way to defeat the angels, that students should not panic, and that he is definitely not currently hiding under his desk. McDonald added that classes are scheduled to continue normally tomorrow in all areas not effected by the Angels.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Stay safe, students!

		<Title>Jensen Closes Borders as Bankus Refugee Crisis Worsens</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>College</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Under pressure from fed-up residents, RAs at the Jensen residence hall at Audacity College announced today that Jensen would no longer be admitting refugees from the ongoing wild party at neighboring Bankus hall. The party originated on September 14th in the third floor common room of Bankus Hall with four guys and three girls hanging out together and eating doritoes, but when one resident opened a case of beers, the party began to escalate. On the fifteenth, it had spread to the entire third floor and was creeping down the stairs, and marijuana use began to intensify. Campus Public Safety was called, but decided that the party was not quite worth making a scene over. However, they did make a definitive, with the head of CPS saying, &quot;A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of cocaine moving around or being utilized.&quot; At this point, Bankus had already become so vomit-encrusted and unlivable that less wild residents began fleeing to neighboring res halls. On the sixteenth, the party grew to fully dominate the two upper floors, and that night, the first evidence came out of cocaine use. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				CPS immediately began preparing to close down the party, but an agreement was reached in which the party could continue as long as the party turned over all the cocaine and super-promised not to use anymore. Reports have since indicated that cocaine use didn't even slow down, but at this point CPS was afraid to touch another Bankus Hall quagmire after what had happened the last time they had tried to shut down a party. Students from other res halls, and even as far away as University of Rockettopia, began to pour into Bankus to participate in the party, leading to even more refugees making the dangerous trek across Tower Terrace to the safety of Jensen.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				That brings us to today, when in response to the dozens of Bankus residents who now appeared to be living in their hall, the Jensen RAs declared that no further refugees from the Bankus party would be allowed in. This has drawn massive criticism from student rights groups, who have insisted that Jensen has a moral obligation to accept those fleeing from the Bankus party because they just want to get some goddamn sleep. However, some students, especially in Jensen, have expressed fears that these so-called &quot;refugees&quot; could be undercover partiers who might spread the party to Jensen. We will keep you posted as this story continues, which is something that I actually mean this time.

				Over the last few hours, the YikYak feed for University of Rockettopia has become dominated by posts
				expressing love for trees, for some reason, leading to concern among the Rockettopia tree comunity. 
				As posts like &quot;I may be a tree and still the sausage&quot; have proliferated over the last few hours, local
				trees have expressed confusion. &quot;[creaking wood] [rustling leaves] [subtilly different creaking wood]
				[whistling of wind]&quot;, a somewhat freaked-out local birch told News from Rockettopia. &quot;[a series of sounds
				that cannot even be described]&quot; A few trees have passed by mere concern and moved on to fear, noting that
				generally when University of Rockettopia students mention plants, those plants are quickly ground up, wrapped
				in paper, and lit on fire.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				University of Rockettopia students have responded to the issue with a resounding &quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;

		<Title>Relations Between Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj Tense Following VMA Incident</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				International observers have expressed concern following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mtv.com/news/2257165/nicki-minaj-miley-cyrus-beef-is-real/&quot;&gt;yesterday's 
				confrontation between Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj at the MTV Video Music Awards.&lt;/a&gt;
				The incident occurred during Minaj's acceptance of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/91/77/6d6a260f994b6ef568c40a9e7024f957.jpg&quot;&gt;Best 
				Porn Set To Music&lt;/a&gt;, just after she had thanked her pastor (Apparently she has a pastor). Minaj, a piece of plastic augmented with human implants, called
				former child star and current pop culture reference Miley Cyrus a &quot;bitch&quot;, apparently in response to Cyrus' comments the previous day. According to firsthand
				accounts, Minaj then asserted her dominance by shoving her new award completely into her vagina, pulling it out, and shouting &quot;Suck on that, whore!&quot;, but by this
				time the frantic editors at MTV had cut to commercial break.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				It has now been nearly twenty-four hours, and tensions are still high. For the moment, the conflict has failed to escalate beyond small exchanges of tweets, but
				the situation could still intensify further. As international relations experts expert Laura Blumenfeld told News from Rockettopia when we contacted her, &quot;Who the
				fuck are you guys? It's two in the morning! Uh huh, uh huh... Wait, you want my opinions on &lt;b&gt;what&lt;/b&gt;? You gotta be fucking with me. I'm going back to sleep, and
				if this is you Hillary, you better watch your personal email servers &lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; carefully.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				As things stand now, Cyrus and Minaj are facing off, with neither willing to make the first move. Cyrus has deployed construction equipment near Minaj's secret lair
				in Malibu, a move which she calls &quot;defensive&quot;. Meanwhile, Minaj has been seen with large amounts of dangerous reptiles, and no, we do not mean her fans. She has said
				in her defense that she only aquired the reptiles because she enjoys being surrounded by scaly, cold-blooded eating machines with very little brain and the papparazzi 
				can't be everywhere at once. According to an expert who appeared today on MTV, if Minaj wins the potential conflict, Cyrus could always flee to Sweden, which has declared
				Nicki Minaj's ass an &quot;unknown and potentially dangerous material&quot; and banned her from entering the country until research can be conducted.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				As this political quagmire continues, we will continue to bring you coverage until we get bored.

			&lt;p&gt;
				Following numerous complaints regarding the policy on extension cords in dormitories, the &lt;del&gt;principal&lt;/del&gt; president of Audacity College (Rockettopia's
				greatest institute of higher learning) established a review board to compile, clarify, and rewrite the extension cord policies. Although the freshmen arrived
				only yesterday and classes have yet to start, the change is already overdue. According to one freshman we interviewed, &quot;The rules are too damn complected. Our RA
				told us that extension cords were allowed only with surge protectors, the staff told us no extension cords at all, the oracle told me that extension cords are the work
				of Ba'al the soul-eater and must be purged from the earth, and that guy over at Sigma Alpha Epsilon told me that I could have an extension cord only if I did 
				engaged in an obscene activity with him and some of his buddies. Those are some seriously mixed messages.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although the board only began their work today, they have already been making headlines. The issue of chain power strips, which are allowed according to the RAs
				and the campus guide but banned by the head of CPS is still not resolved, In addition, the Rockettopia Society for Public Morality has kept the decades-old town-wide ban 
				on power strips from being repealed (Electric transfer should be between one plug and one outlet!). It also did not help that the Department of Society for Public Morality
				opposes all kinds of protection in the belief that it leads to excessive plugging, which should occur only for the purposes of electrical transfer after an installation
				performed by a trained electrical engineer.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				As the Society for Public Morality continues their doomed crusade against obscene circuitry practices, the Extension Cord Board will continue to review Audacity College's
				entire Extension Cord Code along with all related College Court decisions, going all the way back to a dispute over an overextended &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_shaft&quot;&gt;
				line shaft&lt;/a&gt; from 1879. For the record, the owner was at fault for the tragic accident involving his roommate's girlfriend's hair. All that can be said so far is that,
				despite rumors to the contrary, neither garlic nor crucifixes can be used on dorm room doors to keep RAs from searching the rooms.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Expect updates &lt;del&gt;if&lt;/del&gt; as this issue is cleared up.

		<Title>Teenage Boy Goes Away to College, Donates Large Collection of Rocks to Day-Care Center</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				As a local teenage boy cleaned out his room for a final time in preparation for his move to college, he donated his collection of unusual and exotic rocks
				to a local daycare. The rocks, which have been whittled down by purges, accidents, and yard sales over the years, were placed in a plastic trash bag. Supposedly,
				the bag was intended to be destined for the attic, but instead the rocks somehow ended up at a local day-care, where they met lots of new rocks. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, as fate
				would have it, the daycare center was actually a prison ruled by the rose quartz fist of a pink bear-shaped rock. After a heart-pounding escape and many adventures,
				the rocks finally found their way home. Their owner, realizing that his rock-years were behind him, gave them to a young girl who loves rocks as much as he did. As
				he drove away to college, the rocks silently said goodbye to their old friend as millions of onlookers smiled and cried.

		<Title>America Outraged Over Senseless Murders of Predatory Cat, Inanimate Object</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The American people collectively exploded in indignation this week after the tragic deaths of Cecil, a large, predatory cat and HitchBOT, an inanimate object.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The first to die was Cecil the Lion, a Zimbabwean tourist attraction, who was killed on July 1st 2015, but whose death was not reported until last week. Cecil 
				was lured out of Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park and shot with a crossbow. Forty hours later, he was finished off with a gun. Cecil was then beheaded, skinned,
				and left to rot. The perpetrator of this travesty was Walter Palmer, a dentist from Minnesota. Palmer is believed to be the second most evil dentist of all time,
				just ahead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0015572/?ref_=tt_cl_t2&quot;&gt;Dr. Christian Szell&lt;/a&gt; and right behind your dentist. Since the news of Cecil's
				death and the identity of his killer 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/11767119/Cecil-the-lions-killer-revealed-as-American-dentist.html&quot;&gt;broke on July 
				28th, Palmer has been forced to close down his dental practice and go into hiding as a result of massive public outcry and death threats&lt;/a&gt;.
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/04/cecil--lion-beanie-baby-ty-inc/31095541/&quot;&gt;Ty Inc., the makers of Beanie Babies, has announced a
				Cecil the Lion Beanie Baby, the profits from which will go to a conservationist charity,&lt;/a&gt; making thousands of Americans stop and ask, &quot;Wait, Beanie Babies are sill
				a thing?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/03/delta-bans-hunting-trophies-cecil-the-lion&quot;&gt;Three US Airlines, American, United, and Delta, have
				announced that they will no longer ship certain hunting trophies&lt;/a&gt;, at least until we all forget this sometime next week and cease to care. 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/03/cecil-the-lion-honored-as-part-empire-state-building-light-show/&quot;&gt;Yesterday, Cecil was even
				honored as part of a million-dollar light show at the Empire State Building&lt;/a&gt;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Only days later, as the country was still reeling from the death of an animal that no one had heard of before last week, 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/03/hitchhiking-robots-cross-country-journey-comes-to-tragic-end-in-philadelphia/?tid=pm_national_pop_b&quot;&gt;
				Americans were shocked again when it was discovered that HitchBOT, an object that was taken from place to place by humans, was dismembered in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. 
				HitchBOT had already hitchhiked 3,600 miles across Canada, and traveled in Germany and the Netherlands, but was unprepared for the mindless destructiveness of Americans. 
				Starting in Boston, HitchBOT made it for two weeks and 300 miles before vandals sent his creators an image of him headless and dismembered in a pile of trash. This 
				was after he had survived Bostonians &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; New Yorkers. The Internet has since been expressing outrage and snide commentaries, mainly boiling down to &quot;You know you're
				fucked up when your country contains more mindless, directionless hate than &lt;b&gt;Germany&lt;/b&gt;&quot;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The combination of these two acts of pointless savagery has finally pushed America to the breaking point. The country has survived a corrupt government with no connection
				to reality, a string of mass shootings, and the periodic murders of innocent minorities by law enforcement, but the deaths of a fierce predator and an electric trashcan
				were simply too much to bear. &quot;I'd been hearing all this stuff about 'black lives matter' and 'climate change' and 'mexican drug wars' and 'ISIS Genocides',&quot; a Rockettopian
				citizen told News from Rockettopia. &quot;but that poor killing machine and that hamper with speech recognition really got to me. What is the world becoming?&quot; Many have speculated
				that the outcry over the deaths of Cecil and HitchBOT have been because they had names, however NAACP activist LaSheefa Jones told us that this is not the case. &quot;Black folks
				have been naming their children for years. That hasn't made rich white folks care when they get shot by cops.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In related news, members of the black community have reversed their previous statements and now wish to be treated at the very least as well as animals.

		<Title>Nation Wishes It Could Just Have A Few Weeks Between Mass Shootings</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				After &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/what-happened-inside-that-louisiana-movie-theater/2015/07/24/bf3b784e-322f-11e5-a879-213078d03dd3_video.html&quot;&gt;
				another mass shooting this week, this time in Lafayette, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, the American people came together to mourn and to ask if maybe we can have a break between 
				mass shootings, please? The Lafayette shooting follows &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/16/us/tennessee-naval-reserve-shooting/&quot;&gt;a shooting that took place
				on two Chattanooga, Tennessee military bases a week earlier&lt;/a&gt;, leading Americans to ask if two weeks, tops, is too much to ask for between senseless atrocities?
				The Chattanooga shooting itself occurred less than a month after a shooting at a church in Charleston, SC that killed nine people including a state legislator, which
				in turn probably followed something else but at this point there have been so many that we can't even keep track. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;
				http://www.rockettopia.com/article.php?article=mass_shooting_gets_little_coverage&quot;&gt;our coverage of the UCA Santa Barbra shooting&lt;/a&gt;, something which I had totally
				forgotten about despite the fact that it was barely a year ago and seven people &lt;b&gt;died&lt;/b&gt;, proving my point.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				But despite the fact that mass shootings are now as much a part of American life as naked pics, snapchat, and that &quot;oh shit&quot; moment when snapchat tells you that
				someone screenshotted your naked pic, Americans told us that they would at least like to finish burying the victims before more victims needed to be buried.
				&quot;It's kind of crazy that by the time the funerals for the Chattanooga victims started, there had already been another murderous rampage,&quot; some guy we found on a
				street corner told News from Rockettopia. &quot;These deranged psychopaths should show some respect.&quot; As America briefly takes a moment to mourn the victims of Lafayette, 
				it also takes a moment to begin digging the graves for the victims of the next mass shooting, which is expected sometime in the next few months.
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>37 Million Assholes Freak Out After Massive Karma Spill</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>Miscellaneous</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				37 million completely freaked out following a massive spill of karma from the dating site AshleyMadison. AshleyMadison,
				&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison&quot;&gt;a dating site specifically targeted at married people looking to have an affair,
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/hackers-threaten-to-expose-40-million-cheating-ashleyma-1718965334&quot;&gt;suffered a massive security breach yesterday
				in which hackers styling themselves &quot;The Impact Team&quot; stole the names, credit cards, and personal information of the site's 37 million members&lt;/a&gt;,
				thereby unleashing the greatest spill of karma in recent memory. The Impact Team announced the hack with the following spectacular image.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;width:100%&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/ashleymadison_threat.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;They're fucked&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&quot;The last time we saw this kind of a massive karmasheheda, or universal release of karma, was when 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/world/middleeast/suicide-bomb-instructor-accidentally-kills-iraqi-pupils.html&quot;&gt;an 
				Iraqi suicide bombing instructor accidentally blew up his entire class of ISIS terrorists-in-training&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Swami Gustapa Malahari, a white woman in her 30s at
				the Inner Peace Yoga Studio in Rockettopia, told News from Rockettopia. &quot;It's kind of spectacular. Truly the gods have smiled upon us.&quot; (Note: In our research,
				we were unable to determine actual the meaning of the word &quot;karmasheheda&quot;, or find any references to it at all.) Even noted monster Noel Biderman, the CEO
				of AshleyMadison, told News from Rockettopia that he couldn't help feeling slightly &quot;entertained&quot; and &quot;satisfied&quot; by the hack. &quot;I mean, it's a disaster for us, but
				I must admit to a bit of schadenfreude at watching these people get it. I know my business model explicitly facilitates the destruction of marriages, but let's face it,
				my clients are terrible people.&quot;. &quot;This is all off the record,&quot; Biderman added. &quot;Right?&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite Biderman's stance, this is shaping up to be the worst disaster in AshleyMadison's history, beating out their failed bumper sticker campaign two years ago.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;width:100%&quot;&gt; 
				&lt;img src=&quot;images/ashleymadison_bumpersticker.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;I enjoy making these so much&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Many notables have been observed acting strangely since the AshleyMadison leak. Bill Clinton has taken Hillary out on four dates, which is four more than in all
				of last year. Anthony Weiner is reportedly hiding in a wardrobe and refusing to come out. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are both being very nice to each other,
				and Newt Gingrich told the press that his stance on family values was &quot;Open to change.&quot;. When Donald Trump found out about the leak, a worried expression reportedly
				crossed his face, before he said to himself &quot;Eh, whatever.&quot; and moved on with being a dick to veterans.

		<Title>Museum of Assholery Announces New "Donald J. Trump Hall"</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Donald Trump</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Following comments by the real estate mogul and - *cringe* - presidential candidate Donald Trump yesterday, the Museum of Assholery announced that they would
				be constructing a new &quot;Donald J. Trump Hall&quot;. This decision stems from Trump's remarks regarding distinguished Senator John McCain, who was captured and tortured
				while serving in Vietnam. The Museum, located in - where else? - Newark, New Jersey, said that while the hall is still being designed,
				it would aim to provide &quot;A complete perspective on the monster that is Donald Trump&quot;. What is known already is that, when completed, the Hall will be &quot;The finest,
				classiest, most luxurious hall of any hall ever built!&quot; Preliminary plans call for a two-story hall three hundred by one hundred meters, although designers have said
				that packing all of Trump's achievements into such a size hall would be a &quot;challenge&quot;, and featuring Trump's recent remarks about McCain above the main entrance.
				&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/18/draft-dodging-trump-says-pow-mccain-not-a-war-hero.html&quot;&gt;[John McCain]'s not a war hero&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; the sign will 
				read in four meter tall gold-embossed letters. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/18/draft-dodging-trump-says-pow-mccain-not-a-war-hero.html&quot;&gt;He's
				a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Museum's director, Arnold A. Griffith, said in a press release that Trump himself would be paying all costs for the exhibit. &quot;We just gave him the paperwork and told
				him that we wanted to build a hall honoring his life and legacy, and he went crazy. He started drooling and hyperventilating, and signed everything we put in front of him,
				even the business card we gave him as we were leaving.&quot; As an afterthought, Griffith added, &quot;I think I saw him unzipping his pants as I was walking out the door.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Once the hall is completed, which is scheduled for sometime in 2016, Trump will join notables such as Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Harry Ried, el Chapo, John Edwards,
				Oliver North, Dick Cheney, and many others in the museum. The Museum of Assholery is open from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays, and from 8 AM to 7 PM on saturdays.

			&lt;p&gt;
				The formerly-popular amusement park SeaWorld declared that they will be closing all their facilities following a condemnation from One Direction star and
				all-time Fuck, Marry, Kill champion Harry Styles. 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eonline.com/news/675038/harry-styles-urges-dolphin-loving-one-direction-fans-to-avoid-seaworld-earns-peta-s-praises&quot;&gt;Styles spoke out
				against the noted evil organization in a San Diego concert yesterday.&lt;/a&gt; After seeing noted Game of Thrones star and Fuck, Marry, Kill runner-up Maisie
				Williams, who also advocates for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dolphinproject.org/&quot;&gt;The Dolphin Project&lt;/a&gt;, Harry told the audience, &quot;Does anybody here like dolphins?
				Don't go to SeaWorld!&quot;. In the following hours, SeaWorld saw its attendance drop to a crawl. One of the few remaining SeaWorld guests, a tattooed man with a 
				waist-length beard and the odor of a confederate flag supporter, told News from Rockettopia, &quot;Yeah, I love Harry and yeah, I know all about the dolphins, 
				but I'm still here. Not because I approve of SeaWorld and not because I don't care - I'm here because I'm sexually aroused by tortured whales.&quot; He attempted
				to say more, but any further comments were directed at the back of our quickly-receding reporter's head.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				SeaWorld CEO and terrible human being Joel Manby announced today that, in response to Harry's comments, SeaWorld would be liquidating all its assets and closing
				all its facilities. &quot;We managed to continue our operations despite public outrage, multiple investigations, and basic human decency,&quot; Manby said in a public
				statement, &quot;but Harry Edward Styles is a force of nature. He cannot be resisted. He cannot be stopped. Even we at SeaWorld are helpless before his terrible
				might.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Harry Styles has not yet been reached for comment.

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The American public joined together in a collective groan as yet &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; fucking guy entered the 2016 presidential race. 
				The new Republican candidate for president promised all the same things as the rest. He went on to secure his crazy credentials by suggesting 
				&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bobby-jindal-lets-just-get-rid-the-court"&gt; "let's just get rid of the [supreme] court"&lt;/a&gt;. The addition 
				of another, indistinguishable candidate brings the total GOP field to twenty-ish, most of whom, like the new guy, will prove comically irrelevant 
				in the long term.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In related news, that fat, loud guy with the bridge thing is expected to announce his candidacy sometime this week.

				Billionare idiot Donald Trump entered the 2016 presidential race yesterday, promising to "Turn this country around", "Create jobs", "Destroy ISIS", and
				"Make this whole thing much more interesting". Trump, a known asshole and far-right celebrity candidate, is expected to provide months of entertainment as
				he fails to realize that he has no chance whatsoever. Soon, the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire will be subjected to Donald Trump, but for now we have only
				his oath that he will "shake things up" and "ensure that this race never gets boring". As of this writing, Trump is outpolling Rick Santorum, Rick Perry,
				Carly Fiorina, and Lindsay Graham.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Rockettopia representitive and presidential candidate Bill Stoner responeded to Trump's announcement by commenting "There goes my reason for existing."

				The entire town of Rockettopia was placed on lockdown yesterday after a local resident mistook a pair of unusually-shaped bushes for escaped murderers
				David Sweat and Richard Matt. Sweat and Matt escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6th, dealing a substantial blow to the prison's
				reputation and to Hillary's 2016 bid. According to the information currently available, Sweat and Matt were assisted by prison employee Joyce Mitchell.
				Matt, by the current accounts, seduced Mitchell and convinced her to aid in the escape. 
				&lt;a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/251718/convict-may-have-used-huge-cock-to-escape-from-prison/"&gt;According to Detective David Bentley, who 
				helped capture Matt in 1997, Matt is "Very handsome and, in all frankness, very well endowed. He gets girlfriends any place he goes."&lt;/a&gt; Bentley
				continued, "Yeah, he sure is good looking. When he walks in wearing only his underwear, just... wow!" As the reporters began to whisper and back away, a
				seemingly entranced Bentley concluded, "Honestly, it's kind of amazing this didn't happen sooner; I'd do anything to get a piece of that ass..." Authorities
				are currently engaged in a massive hunt for Sweat and Matt. They say that if you see them, do not attempt to apprehend them and contact the authorities
				immediately. In addition, do not under any circumstances allow Matt to drop his pants.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				For a few hours yesterday, it looked like the search for Matt and Sweat was over after a Rockettopia resident called police to report that he had seen
				the duo in a public park, standing very still and covered in leaves. The town was immediately placed on lockdown and the national guard was called in. However,
				after an eighteen-hour search failed to find any trace of Sweat and Matt, the guard concluded that there had been a false alarm. However, the anonymous resident
				who called the police remains steadfast, saying in a news conference earlier today that he "Just knew" that the pair of privet bushes were "definitely suspicious"
				and that the authorities were "arrogant" to call off their search so soon. We will bring you more updates concerning Sweat and Matt as the search continues.

		<Title>Slavonistan to Dedicate Troops to War on ISIS</Title>

		<Topic>ISIS</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				America's vital strategic ally Slavonistan yesterday declared that their country is making a late entry into the campaign against the "Daesh", also known as the 
				"Islamic State", "ISIS", "ISIL", "al-Psychopathy", the "Vaguely Islam-y State in the Middle East", and "KILL KILL KILL!!". Slavonistan is a vital American partner 
				in a loosely-defined region somewhere between Germany and China. The Kurdish forces, local Sunni and Shiite militias, and American 'advisors' currently fighting
				ISIS will now enjoy the support of the legendary Slavonistani Turtle Riders, who left yesterday and are scheduled to arrive sometime within the next year. Speaking
				from his eight-room presidential palace in the Slavonistani capitol of Gorbachevgrad, Slavonistani president Viktor al-Stoyomstevski told the press that he would be
				"Honored to defend ze civilized vorld against ze barbarians calling zemselves ze 'Islamic State'. Ze Slavonistani elite turtle cavalry will break zese dogs like
				Croatians." 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				This news is especially exciting for Rockettopia, as we have long enjoyed a special relationship with Slavonistan. In 1992, only months after Slavonistan was formed,
				ambassadors from Gorbachevgrad and Rockettopia met and bonded over the shared experience of having accidentally acquired a large number of nuclear weapons. Gorbachevgrad
				and Rockettopia officially became sister cities in 1994, and we have been running exchange programs ever since. In 2004, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of 
				our partnership, we sent Gorbachevgrad twenty kilos of high-grade marijuana, as they sent us a derelict Soviet tank and crates of Slavonistani swamp grass, which unfortunately
				did not get us high. The tank was repaired in 2010 by the RHS Engineering Club and has since watched menacingly over our disputed border with Raiderton.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The mayor of Rockettopia wished the Slavonistani Grand Army the best of luck fighting ISIS, and we at News from Rockettopia are proud to echo his sentiment. Go forth in
				the name of the goats!
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>Gamers Disappointed to Learn that Assassin's Creed Skill Does Not Translate to Assassins Skill</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				As the RHS Senior Assassins game began this week, the gamer segment of the community was shocked and disappointed to learn that their extensive experience
				with &lt;i&gt;Assassin's Creed&lt;/i&gt; did not give them any advantage in the game. Surprisingly, skill with wrist knives, the ability to press buttons
				really, really fast, and experience killing Templars conferred no ability at tracking down and shooting teenagers with water guns. "I've beaten all the games
				on brutal difficulty, so I thought I'd be fine," local gamer Stephen Thomas told &lt;i&gt;News from Rockettopia&lt;/i&gt;. "But when I tried to hide from my 
				assassin by crouching in tall grass, he just started laughing uncontrollably and then squirted me once he caught his breath!"
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In definitely completely unrelated news, the Engineering Club has claimed that their recent acquisition of staggering amounts of fertilizer and strange 
				activities near the dam are "completely harmless".

			&lt;p&gt;
				The principal of Rockettopia High School resigned today following allegations. At the moment, the content of the allegations, date of the allegations, and
				the name of the alligator are still undisclosed. The principal will be investigated by Rockettopia Public School officials this Wednesday, at which point we
				will have more news. Hopefully, this investigation will determine if any wrongdoing occurred, what wrongdoing may or may not have occurred, when it occurred, 
				where it occurred, and who it was occurred upon. We may even discover the principal's name and gender, which have been mysteries to RHS staff and students for
				years.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The office of the superintendent will neither confirm nor deny that the principal's resignation relates to the new doorbell at the high school, which is just
				stupid.

				After &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wjhl.com/story/28935156/hawkins-co-school-officials-commissioner-respond-to-dated-lunch-meat-served-to-students&quot;&gt;
				county administrators in Hawkins County, Tennessee discovered six-year-old food being served in the school cafeterias&lt;/a&gt;, students rose up in protest,
				demanding food that was, at worst, two years old. Students told News from Rockettopia that they would like less than 110 generations of maggots in their
				daily sustenance, but were willing to negotiate for maybe up to 200 generations, tops. One student told our reporter, who is currently in the next room
				vomiting uncontrollably, that she "Would have felt a little guilty asking for food that was less than six months old." Health risks aside, Hawkins County's
				food, which is apparently often older than some of its consumers, cause disruptions in the rest of the school day. "Every time a student has to be rushed to
				the hospital with food poisoning, I have to stop class and call their parents," a sixth-grade history teacher told our reporter, who I should really check on
				some time soon. "After the third or fourth time it happens in a single class period, I start having trouble getting the students back on track." The situation
				was not improved when students were interrupted mid-lunch by UNESCO, which had declared that day's chicken a nature reserve.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite the fact that their lunches would soon be able to file for retirement benefits in France, the students at Hawkins' Cherokee High School declined
				Rockettopia's offer to send a supply of fresh KFC. "Our food may be six years old, but at least it's food."

				As students at RHS returned from spring break this week, the senior class began the final blazing stretch of slacking off. With only a month left until graduation,
				the seniors are now putting all possible effort into not really caring about their studies, because now that college admissions are all back, nothing really matters.
				"It's a lot of work," senior Zach Schienfeld told News from Rockettopia. "But I've managed to go down an entire letter grade in English." Current predictions are that
				seniors will have fully lost interest in school by the time of their finals.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In related news, the high-school juniors are unusually resentful right now.

		<Text>
			I will be stuck behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/&quot; &gt;Great Firewall of China&lt;/a&gt; for the next week, so here's a conversation
			I had with a Skype spambot when I was bored:
			&lt;style&gt;
			.meMsg {
				margin-left: auto;
				text-indent: 0px;
				width: 66%;
				background-color: #e5f7fd;
				padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px;
			}

			.botMsg {
				margin-right: auto;
				text-indent: 0px;
				width: 66%;
				background-color: #c7edfc;
				padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px;
			}
			&lt;/style&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				who are you?
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				hey babe u around? &lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				i got ure name from the directory here on skype cuz i was bored and lookin for new people to talk to. lol
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				are you a robot? I thought so. Why are there robots on skype?
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				so whatcha up to?
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				Right now I'm chatting with a robot because I'm kind of bored.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				i'm just about to go on spring break at school, i'm still in college right now so i can't wait ya know
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				Now algorithms go to college? What is the world coming to?
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				lol, so i have an idea if ure up for a lil fun
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				I'm increasingly feeling that we're having two different conversations.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				i was actually going to be getting to &quot;work&quot; here shortly. my girlfriend was working online and i kept askin her about it so she showed me what 
				she was doing when we got back to school after summer break
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				It was clever of your programmer to work in the delay&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				But maybe you should actually respond to what I say?
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				lol i thought she was nuts at first, but its pretty cool actually. we work online doing private webcam shows which sounded weird at first believe me. 
				but i freakin luv it!!!
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				No one will believe that you're human.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				Okay, now give me a link to a site that will give me a virus already!
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				well what i was going to say is i have some free passes and i usually just do a private show before i get started to &quot;warm up&quot; lol. no one is online 
				though so i was going to give u one of the passes if u wanted but u have to give me a really good rating so i can get more if u do tho k
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				Oh, you respond differently when I interrupt you! That's very interesting, but it still can't make up for the fact that your responses have nothing to do 
				with what I say. However, while we're on the topic of personal proposals (I'm just going to assume that you will soon send me a link to a website where you
				claim that you will be naked on camera, and then the site will infect my computer with a virus or something), do you have any commands that will illicit an actual response?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				Are you not going to respond? I was enjoying our chat, even if you aren't human, or even a very convincing impersonation thereof.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				dont u worry tho... ill earn it lol. k its http://bit.ly/1LVdepy and u should see a lil button to accept my invite and create your profile. u just click on that.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				then you just make ure own username or w/e and u can cumm into my private chat for the 2 of us and type to me and tell me what you want me to do
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				Oh, even cleverer than just a virus! I make an account with a standard username, email, and password a la https://xkcd.com/792/, and then you hack into my bank or email or 
				some such. Very clever, except that your impression of an actual human is kind of depressing. No one actually falls for this, right
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				yea you do need a cc of some kind... but, its just to verify your age&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				this is the &quot;special&quot; page for special ppl!! lol im such a goofball sumtimes
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				Ah, fascinating! You respond to various text cues like &quot;email&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, or &quot;password&quot;. You're still not a half-passable impersonation of a human being, but I guess it's 
				something.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				i really can't wait too it's gonna be so much fun. i love meeting new ppl on here, oh by the way... might wanna turn ure speakers down cuz i can get a 
				lil loud once i get going
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				You do realize that the overlap between &quot;people who use skype&quot; and &quot;people who will not immediately recognize this as a scam of some sort&amp;quot; is exactly zero, right?
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;botMsg&quot;&gt;
				i'm about to go grab some of my favorite &quot;toys&quot; i'll brb. hurry up though i better see ure name in my room when i get back lol
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				The main thing I'm still wondering is, how long do you go on? How many pre-programmed responses do you have?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				I suspect that was the last one. Are there any more?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;meMsg&quot;&gt;
				I guess that's it. It was nice talking to you, robot!

		<Title>Senior Class Instructed to Stop Doing Drugs; "We're Serious This Time", says Administration</Title>

				In a special assembly during homeroom today, the school administration told the 
				senior class that they should really lay off the drugs until graduation. The
				administration passed out forms to all the seniors which the seniors and their parents
				had to sign, promising that the seniors would cease doing drugs for a month before 
				graduation. "I'm aware that technically, drinking and smoking on school property is
				illegal all year around, but this time we really mean it," the principal told News from 
				Rockettopia." If you smoke or drink on school property during this time, you will be in a 
				lot of trouble."
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The principal concluded his announcement with his daily warning that a rabid wolf had
				somehow found its way into the school.

		<Title>Our Mr. Rockettopia Predictions</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The annual Mr. Rockettopia competition will be held this Wednesday in the auditorium at 7:00 PM. As many readers will know, Mr. Rockettopia is a talent 
				show in which seniors showcase their looks and talents in a battle to be voted this year's Mr. Rockettopia. Talents that are showcased include music, 
				dancing, and comedy. One contestant this year had planned to do 'reverse stripping' as his talent, but this was vetoed by the administration on the 
				grounds that they couldn't figure out what he meant but were too embarrassed to say so. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The administration was given veto power after an unfortunate incident in 2003 when a contestant showcased his talent for doing many, many different 
				kinds of drugs at once. By the time security tackled him thirty seconds into his performance, he had used alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, LSD,
				heroin, meth, toads, mushrooms, ecstasy, and something that he has to this day refused to name. The very, very hardworking staff of the Mary Mellon 
				hospital later told News from Rockettopia that the incident was "unique" and "bizarre" and that it had "required that they develop completely new
				ways of detoxing patients". One Mary Mellon doctor won a Nobel prize in medicine two years later for his paper on the interaction LSD with alcohol, 
				heroin, marijuana, and psychedelic mushrooms. The contestant recovered and graduated later that year (After serving two detentions for his "little stunt"). 
				There is a shrine to him behind the garage in the lower lot and the Existential Club still celebrates his birthday every year.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Mr. Rockettopia race this year is still very much up in the air, but we're willing to make a few predictions. First, there is a roughly 5% chance that 
				something else will go wrong with the electrical grid, and the event will have to be postponed again. There is a 18% chance that all but one of the
				contestants will suffer mysterious injuries or deaths in the next twenty-four hours. The chance that at least one competitor will be disqualified 
				for being a &lt;a href="http://www.davidicke.com/headlines/the-reptilian-agenda/"&gt;reptilianoid&lt;/a&gt; is roughly 8%. The chance that at least one competitor
				will be eaten by the strange creature that spends the day in the art department and sneaks out at night to feed on the janitors is 22%, with an 
				error bar of +-4 points. The police assure us that the chance that the bagpipers trapped in the supply closet will escape and play bagpipes at the 
				audience is very small, but they have positioned officers with ear protection around the closet anyway. The chance that a contestant will do another
				stupid fucking magic show is 95%. The chance that it will be annoying is 99%.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In summary, our pick to win Mr. Rockettopia this year is a toss-up between Zayn from One Direction and Texas senator Ted Cruz. Be sure to attend!

		<Title>Sectarian Violence Erupts Over Color of Dress</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The last two days has seen the world abuzz with one of the weirdest controversies in living memory: the color of what has become known
				simply and ominously as &quot;The Dress&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://swiked.tumblr.com/post/112073818575/guys-please-help-me-is-this-dress-white-and&quot;&gt;Some simple research&lt;/a&gt;
				demonstrates that patient zero began infecting tumblr users
				on February 25th, 2015. The outbreak spread with shocking speed - by February 27th, The Dress was on news programs and was discussed across
				Rockettopia High School. The author of this article witnessed two separate arguments over the color of the dress on a 
				single trip to a drinking fountain.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The dress in question, which, let's face it, you've already seen, is obviously white and gold but appears blue and black to people who
				aren't very good at perceiving color. Confrontations between those who believe that the dress is white and gold, known as &quot;Golds&quot;, and
				those who for some reason believe that the dress is blue and black, known as &quot;Blues&quot;, have become violent in the last eight hours. The
				Blues currently control the deserts of the math department, far-off lands of the world language department, the small but rich history 
				department, and the English department tundra- basically the entire new building - while the Golds have taken the swamps of the music 
				department, the graphic design forest, the endless plains of the gym, and the art department highlands. Fierce fighting has devestated
				the hallways that connect the old building to the new building. In an act of stunning savagery, the heretic Blues recently burned a student
				who dared question their archaic beliefs. The Blues claim that 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/business/a-simple-question-about-a-dress-and-the-world-weighs-in.html&quot;&gt;another picture of The Dress&lt;/a&gt;
				proves that it's blue and black, despite the fact that the picture is clearly of a different dress (You can tell because, unlike The Dress, the dress
				in the picture is blue and black), and even if it was the same dress, the picture is not accepted as canon by the vast majority of the Dress community.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Since the conflict began, the school administration has been holed up in the offices and still claims to be the legitimate leadership of the school,
				a claim which any observation of the situation will easily refute. They have issued a statement calling the entire issue &quot;silly&quot; and saying that the
				color of a dress is &quot;not worth killing each other for&quot;. This is true, because the dress is clearly white and gold and it's silly to say otherwise.
				However, the administration later stated &quot;The whole thing is absurd, but you know, the dress &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; actually blue. It's kind of clear.&quot; They will be
				purged with the rest of the heretics.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				This reporter hopes that the fighting will end soon. Either the Golds will see reason or they and all other heretics will be slaughtered like dogs. One
				way or another, it will end.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;images/students.jpg&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thirty seconds before the shooting started&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				drugs&lt;/a&gt; has policy-makers across the board rushing to not change their views on legalization. The study, which shows that Marijuana is less
				lethal when it comes to overdoses than pretty much any other drug on the market, has led to a massive number of politicians and demagogues
				continuing in their respective directions regarding the legalization of marijuana. Those who oppose legalization have simply ignored
				the study, while those who support legalization continue to ignore the research suggesting that pot has adverse effects on the brain.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When reached for comment, the principal of Rockettopia High School stated that he was actively ignoring the science on marijuana and would continue
				doing so indefinitely.

		<Title>New Movie &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt; Presents Hope for Acceptance of Abusive Relationships</Title>

				Trigger Warnings: Sexual Abuse. Because &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The film &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt; opened to massive crowds yesterday, giving hope to those in abusive relationships who strive for
				their love to be accepted. &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Anastasia Steele, a virginal college student who meets billionaire Christian Grey.
				She falls in love with Grey, and he coerces her into engaging in his kinky torture sex fetishes. (I warned you about the trigger warnings)
				These include &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:black&quot;;&gt;Wait, you actually highlighted this to read the details? Seek help now.&lt;/span&gt;. The
				&lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/i&gt; movie has, for the most part, received fairly positive reviews simply because the book set the bar so low. If the movie
				&lt;b&gt;hadn't&lt;/b&gt; been better than the book, theaters would have refused to show it. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2015/02/10/fifty-shades-of-grey-film-is-bound-to-please/&quot;&gt;
				some reviewers&lt;/a&gt; have manages to cut through the exceeding of their low expectations to remember that this movie is still terrible. Phrases like 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/02/10/50-shades-grey-review-mediocre-plot-bland-characters-twisted-subject-matter/&quot;&gt;banal and
				degrading&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/fifty-shades-of-grey-20150211&quot;&gt;&quot;a dull, decorous affair, about as erotic as an
				ad for Pottery Barn&quot;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://observer.com/2015/02/fifty-shades-of-grey-is-as-sexy-as-a-root-canal/&quot;&gt;&quot;about as sexy as a root canal&quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
				and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2015/02/12/its-about-as-sexy-as-a-root-canal-and-other-ridiculing-reviews-of-fifty-shades/&quot;&gt;many
				more&lt;/a&gt; have been used to describe &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/i&gt;. As an &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.about.com/od/newmoviesandreviews/fl/Review-Fifty-Shades-of-Grey.htm&quot;&gt;About.com reviewer writes&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;The fact that 
				Fifty Shades  is ostensibly about sex isn't what makes it bad, though: It's all the stuff in it that James' original un-original work that screenwriter 
				Kelly Marcel (Saving Mr. Banks) didn't have the foresight, the energy or the authority to remove that makes it not merely bad but actively dangerous.&quot;
				The movie... Actually, just read the damn reviews yourself, weep, and come back when you're done - I don't have the space or patience to list the many, many
				things here that are truely fucked up.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Whatever its downsides, the movie has at least opened society's eyes to the plight of those in abusive relationships. Today, many women whose boyfriends
				hurt, abuse, and degrade them are routinely given help by their friends and family. &quot;People need to understand that my boyfriend owns me - he enjoys making
				me cry and that's nobody's business but his.&quot;, an abused woman told us. &quot;Our love may be different, but it doesn't mean that it's wrong that my boyfriend is
				turned on by my pain.&quot; The woman told us that she has high hopes that &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/i&gt; will show people how touching and romantic abusive relationships can
				be, and how just because one member of a relationship controls every aspect of the other one's life.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite all this, the closed-minded anti-abusers at the Rockettopia High School Take Back the Night club are organizing a boycott of &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/i&gt;. If
				they keep behaving like this, they might never find a man who will fulfill their dreams of enslavement.

				With New England covered in roughly six feet of snow following the most recent snowstorm, mother nature has come out to explain the snow as an
				"Ice Age Re-enactment". "The world is heating up - soon megablizzards will be a thing of the past", the omnipotent force told reporters in a press
				conference today. "This may be my last chance to stage a massive re-enactment of the Ice Age, so I'm going to take it." Although mile-thick ice
				sheets are not currently in the immediate forecast, more snow is expected this week, so who knows?

		<Title>Athletes and Coaches Rush to Condemn DeflateGate - 'Cheating in Sports Should Be Accomplished Only with Drugs'</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				After the discovery that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;the New England Patriots deliberately deflated their football so as to gain an advantage&lt;/span&gt;,
				prominent athletes, coaches, sports newscasters, and your cousin rushed to condemn what is now being called &quot;DeflateGate&quot;, standing by the
				axiom that all cheating in professional sports should be conducted with drugs. Barry Bonds, who was indicted for perjury and obstruction of
				justice relating to his use of performance enhancing drugs in 2007, was one of the first to speak out. He was soon joined by avatars of
				immorality such as Lance Armstrong and Alex Rodriguez (Dick Cheney being unable to attend), who spoke extensively about the need to
				ensure that all footballs are properly inflated. &quot;This kind of cheating is not okay&quot;, Rodriguez told the &lt;i&gt;Football Herald&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;It's dishonorable;
				not at all like other kinds of cheating such as steroid injections.&quot; Ray Lewis, who in 2013 was caught using Deer Antler Spray, a banned
				performance enhancing drug, told the &lt;i&gt;Herald&lt;/i&gt; &quot;The honor of football must be maintained. Tampering with game equipment constitutes a danger
				to the sport itself. New rules are needed to bring football back to what it should be: A bunch of men in tights, many of them criminals, humping
				each other and giving each other traumatic brain injuries in a game where feet nearly never touch the ball.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				We attempted to contact Lance Armstrong for comments, but he is currently touring his future residence in an unspecified lower circle of hell.

		<Title>RHS Celebrates MLK Day &amp; Cultural Proficiency with African-American-Themed Day</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Rockettopia High School celebrated inclusiveness and African-American culture today with a variety of activities, themes, and special
				events honoring the history and culture of African-Americans in America. The day started with a man dressed as Martin Luther King Jr.
				greeting students with irritating adapted quotes. He looked absolutely nothing like Dr. King and said annoying things like, &quot;I have a
				dream... that you will have a nice day!&quot;. After multiple complaints, the man was removed, but the day was only getting started. Signs
				were posted around the school saying &quot;RHS Students like that our friends are fun and 56% do not use racial slurs in a typical month!
				The Hawaiian Alphabet has 12 letters!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Teachers were encouraged to talk in the style of African-Americans to get in the spirit of the day. Thankfully, very few of them did,
				with one telling News from Rockettopia, &quot;Jesus Christ! I can't believe the shit we have to put up with.&quot; Lunch consisted entirely of
				watermelon and fried chicken, served by real &lt;del&gt;black people&lt;/del&gt; African Americans. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Following the lunch, the school held an assembly
				in which the administration showed a video of Dr. King's famous &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech and then spoke about how it's important to display
				cultural proficiency and to tolerate people with different backgrounds than our own. He then invited the school's African-American students
				to stand up and talk about their experiences, but all of the African-American students had already slipped out and presumably were running
				away as fast as possible. The principal coughed, and then led the remaining students in a chorus of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				At the end of the day, the administration played &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSurzeGvPrQ&quot;&gt;Accidental Racist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on the
				loudspeakers to a shocked silence.&lt;br/&gt;
				We await the lawsuits.

		<Title>Chorus Involved in Occult Activities</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;A startling discovery made in the chorus room on Friday strongly suggests that the chorus is involved in some kind of
				satanic cult.&lt;/span&gt; The obvious response to that is &quot;Yeah, that's not really news.&quot; However, this isn't just the normal occultism associated
				with chorus - this is an actual satanic cult document. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The document, with its original capitalization and spelling, reads:&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;top Left I see eather the DeviL or a cow witch Looks Like it has a thirD&lt;br/&gt;
				eye anD Fire in its mouth.&lt;br/&gt;
				top right I see a Bilding on Fire anD spirits oF the DeaD that DieD in&lt;br/&gt;
				the Bilding anD a guy eather calling something mayBe goD.&lt;br/&gt;
				Bottom Left I see a guy DeaD mayBe impaLed By what Looks Like&lt;br/&gt;
				an axe.&lt;br/&gt;
				Bottom Right I see a guy that Looks Like hes tn a gontLet&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The content raises many questions, most notably being &quot;Am I reading this right?&quot;, &quot;What the hell did I just read?&quot;, &quot;Are you serious?&quot; and
				&quot;Does the chorus really have such bad spelling?&quot;. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The answers to all these questions are &quot;yes&quot;. Except for the third one;
				to answer that, start reading this article from the beginning.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				There are two conclusions to draw about the content of this document, drugs and satanic rituals. However, we spoke the the Wicca club, which
				to be clear, has NO CONNECTION TO SATANISM, and they were able to straighten things out. &quot;The note contains many details that suggest satanism
				as opposed to simple drug use. Not that we would know anything about satanism.&quot; The Wiccan coughed, and then continued, &quot;The way that the lines 
				are slanted indicates a different kind of altered state than one associated with drugs - this state is definitely satanic. Although of course I
				don't really know anything about satanism. Nope, nothing. Nada.&quot; The Wiccan then made some excuses and shuffled away from me.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Whatever the case, an investigation into the chorus' activities is definitely necessary. It's unclear when exactly the note was written - we only
				know that it was discovered during second-block strings period on Friday, January 16th 2015. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;For increased clarity I have scanned
				the note and posted the scan below, despite the chorus director's attempt to destroy it.&lt;/span&gt; The problem of the chorus' occult activity has to be
				dealt with before the Student Council Inquisition gets wind of it - their policy towards satanism is... perhaps a little harsh. I've already said too
				much. Chorus, if you're going to engage in devil-worship in school, please be more tacit about it.

		<Title>Bizarre Error Message Most Interesting Part of RHSN Newscast</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Following yesterday's RHSN broadcast, students generally agreed that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/54sKCJRtREI?t=1m3s&quot;&gt;thirty seconds of 
				red screen&lt;/a&gt; was the most interesting part of the broadcast. An impromptu poll showed that roughly eighty percent of students found the red 
				screen reading "Media Offline bspongebon" to be much more interesting and informative than anything else in this week's newscast, or, for that matter, 
				most RHSN newscasts. "The red screen at least made me perk up and think 'What the hell is going on?' for a moment", one student 
				told News from Rockettopia. "Then the anchors came back on and I dozed off again."
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				RHSN plans to capitalize on this new interest by making every newscast consist entirely of colored screens with meaningless text, which is expected to
				substantially boost their ratings.

		<Title>School Board Considers Cutting Funding for Music Department Buzzing Sound</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In their meeting last night, the Rockettopia school board considered a proposal to reallocate the funds currently devoted to the &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;annoying buzzing sound
				that pervades the RHS music department. The buzzing sound, which is found in nearly every practice room&lt;/span&gt;, acts as 'quality control' in that it keeps the
				quality of Rockettopia's performing arts under control. It ensures that despite all possible attempts, students will be unable to effectively practice in
				the few practice rooms. The avoidance of quality in Rockettopia's performing arts department has been a top priority for years, but in this time of financial
				troubles, even sacred cows such as quality assurance are on the chopping block.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Those who oppose the removal of the buzzing noise point out the great danger of allowing the performing arts to achieve any reasonable
				level of quality, and remind everyone what happened the last time the department did something that amazing. &quot;You all remember the blood, the noise, the chaos.
				The shame of seeing our town on national TV.&quot;, said school board member Anika Johnston. &quot;You remember the fires? It took two days for the fires to die out. Never
				again.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Many board members, however, think that Mrs. Johnston's fears are unwarranted. They point out that the tiny number of practice rooms already keep productivity
				down, and cite the brilliant work of the music department staff in avoiding excess quality. &quot;The choice of musicals is something for which I'm really proud of the
				Performing Arts Department staff.&quot;, Mr. Steve Sanders told News from Rockettopia. &quot;Who knew that there was a musical called &lt;em&gt;Urinetown&lt;/em&gt;? But those 
				geniuses found it and they pulled it off! It more than made up for the dangerously good performance of &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt; in '13. I think &lt;em&gt;Curtains&lt;/em&gt;,
				whatever that is, should suffice this year, but I'll admit that I'm a little disappointed that they aren't doing &lt;em&gt;Springtime for Hitler&lt;/em&gt;. Still, keep up the
				good work, folks!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Other board members have pointed out that cuts to the quality control budget are not unprecedented - nearly a decade ago, budget cuts forced the
				board to cut the jobs of the grand master bagpipers who had previously provided the annoying buzz. The bagpipers were replaced with the machines that now produce
				the noise today, which sadly are far less irritating and have therefore driven fewer students insane. (A side note: According to an anonymous source told 
				us that the bagpipers are actually still in the high school. According to our source, they are in room 227, which does not appear on any maps, is sealed with
				two padlocks and a foot of concrete, is painted to look like a wall, and labeled &quot;Broom Closet. Beware of Leopard&quot;)
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Due to the compelling arguments on both sides, the debate remains heated, although the &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;recent flooding of the music department&lt;/span&gt; 
				has substantially helped the case of those who say that music students are suffering enough even without the buzzing sound. Still, the supporters of the
				buzzing sound are standing firm. Whatever the outcome, we'll give the last word to Steve Sanders: &quot;It's time to stop wasting taxpayer dollars on the annoying
				buzzing sound and just let the music teachers do their job.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
				As is tradition, we at News from Rockettopia have decided to take a moment to remember 2014. So here are the stories that, in a few decades, we will tell
				our grandchildren about, as well as the ones we will try to forget. But mostly that second one. So, in no particular order...
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt; exploded into culture! Everyone was singing 'Let it go', and now no one ever wants to hear that song again.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;ISIS (Also known as ISIL, Daesh, the Islamic State, 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/07/barack-obama/what-obama-said-about-islamic-state-jv-team/&quot;&gt;Terrorism's JV Team,
					&lt;/a&gt;Those Psychos, The Worst People to Invade Iraq since Cheney and Rumsfeld, etc.) literally exploded things in Iraq and Syria. ISIS is a militant
					Islamic extremist group that has committed [Insert all of the most horrifying atrocities that you can imagine, and then add more] and is still at large.
					Even more than usual, I suggest not taking a vacation in Syria over February break.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Okay, so over winter break I took a vacation to the border of al-Qaedia-controlled Syria. So what?&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Race relations in America broke down with the murders of unarmed black men like Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Actually, race relations in America
					were fucked up to begin with, but it took us decades to notice. I have no idea why. I also have no idea why, overall, 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/08/white-people-think-racial-discrimination-in-america-is-basically-over/&quot;&gt;
					white people think that racism against whites is worse than racism against blacks&lt;/a&gt;. I have a whole rant about this, but that is not for today.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The worst Ebola outbreak in history killed thousands of people in West Africa. The outbreak is ongoing, but now that white people are no longer dying,
					it's apparently not a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The entire nation freaked out about Ebola despite dozens of statistics such as these:
						&lt;ul&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;No one who contracted Ebola in the United States has ever died. Never. Anyone. However, I predict that they will die given a few decades.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Twice as many Americans have been married to Larry King as have contracted Ebola.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;The same number of people have contracted Ebola in the US as have married Kim Kardashian. I'm not sure which is worse.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Yeah, you get it, four is a small number, and three recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Republicans beat the Democrats in nearly every race and took complete control of Congress. This would have shaken my faith in the American
					public, except that our response to Ebola had just destroyed that faith entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Obama responded by essentially telling the Republicans to kiss his ass and then reforming immigration and ending the embargo against Cuba.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Vladamir Putin annexed Crimea invaded Ukraine. President Obama responded by decisively lying down and rolling over on his back.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Social pressures propelled the Ice Bucket Challenge to great success, proving that human beings sometimes accidentally do good things while
					trying to impress each other.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;People who are terrible people got to see Jennifer Lawrence naked. This is why I hate having morals.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Interview&lt;/em&gt;, a film in which Seth Rogan and James Franco assassinate Kim Jong-un, outraged the North Korean leadership. People haven't
					been this angry about a movie since the last time Seth Rogan appeared in one. Sony was hacked by someone - no one's sure who, the movie was &lt;i&gt;kind 
					of&lt;/i&gt; released, Obama made one of his strangest speeches ever, and all kinds of other things happened that were, in all likelyhood, much funnier than
					&lt;em&gt;The Interview&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Scotland nearly declared independence, but the vote failed, so let's just move on.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The government of Mexico has been collapsing as a result of public anger from, among other things, the kidnapping and murder of 43 students.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on America's torture program, which included things that are somehow worse than
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockettopia.com/article.php?article=breaking_dawn_part_2_represents_monumental_breakthrough_in_enhanced_interrogation_techniques&quot;&gt;
					the stuff I dreamed up&lt;/a&gt;. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Ixgc_FGam3s&quot;&gt;The Spanish Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;After Hamas began firing rockets, Israel invaded Gaza. Although the thousands of deaths resulting from the conflict would generally rank among the
					worst things that happened in a year, 2013 is an exception because see above.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				I also highly suggest the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/zKx2B8WCQuw&quot;&gt;Youtube Rewind 2014&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					I originally began the process of writing about the pep rally with the intent to write a normal article: start with something real,
					then add some stuff to make it (ideally) funny. But as I spoke to people, I realized that this was a big deal, and I felt that I had an 
					obligation to report the truth, the whole truth, and (For once) nothing but the truth. What you are about to read is as accurate an account
					of the events surrounding the pep rally as I could get. I would like to thank everyone whom I interviewed for this article, especially those
					who put their disciplinary records in danger by talking to me. Their names, along with some sensitive personal information, has been redacted
					for their safety. I will refer to them as Deep Throat, Hobbes, Hashemi, and TJW (TJW stands for Thomas J. Walsh, a top investigator in the 
					famous&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teapot_Dome_scandal&quot;&gt;
					Teapot Dome&lt;/a&gt; scandal). I would also like to thank the school administration for taking time to respond to my questions, despite the fact that they 
					have no oversight over what I write.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					One more note: Throughout this article, I have used gender-neutral pronouns such as
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ze#Etymology_2&quot;&gt;ze&lt;/a&gt;
					when referring to anonymous sources.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					It should go without saying that, at school assemblies, chants of &quot;Bullshit! Bullshit!&quot; are never followed by anything good.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					The pep rally incident, along with the events that caused it and the various ensuing consequences, have been the talk of the school for the last two weeks. 
					The administration has blamed the incident on student disrespect, while the student body has blamed the administration for cuts and censorship. My investigation 
					suggests that, as is so often the case, both sides are partially right. It's probably best to start with what everyone agrees on.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					The pep rally occurred 
					on November 26th, 2014. The beginning of the rally was, as far as I can gather, fairly normal. The main issue was the video made by the senior class, which has 
					been a tradition for six years now. The video was heavily censored, incoherent, and worst of all, it was abruptly cut off by the administration five minutes before 
					the ending. This last offense was too much for the students, and a chant of &quot;Bullshit! Bullshit!&quot; began. The chanting was eventually silenced, and the 
					rally continued as planned. After the school returned from thanksgiving break, which directly follows the pep rally, our school principal, Dr. Pizzi made a morning announcement stating 
					that he was disappointed by the conduct of the students - I seem to remember that the hated word &quot;immature&quot; came up - and that there may not be a pep rally video 
					next year (As you will see, the &quot;may&quot; was somewhat of a misstatement).
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Planning the Rally&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					TJW tells me that the pep rally video has been controversial ever since it began, however, ze said that this year, the students had tried more stuff, and the 
					administration had been harsher in their censorship. Ze say that a lot of the problem is the changing culture of our school.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					i think the culture of the school has changed a lot from what the pep rally originally was. this year was the beginning of being more strict about what can 
					be shown and said, because the focus in the school on acceptance and diversity and respect has increased a ton over the past 2 years. the staff had this 
					thought shift in mind, but the students haven't picked up the trend. why that has happened is a whole other issue/debate/conversation
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					I approached the school administration and asked for a response to some comments made by student sources, among them, this one by TJW. The administration responded,
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					We have been doing a lot of work as a staff and school community around cultural proficiency and school climate over the last few years. Many staff members 
					and even students have taken leadership roles in the effort. We are constantly striving to reach a place where everyone acknowledges and embraces cultural 
					differences and respects human dignity.
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					However, it's not entirely clear to me how &quot;embracing cultural differences&quot; and &quot;respecting human 
					dignity&quot; relate to the pep rally video. Aside from the scene that was cut for being &quot;transphobic&quot;, which we will return to later, most of the content was
					cut to keep it &quot;school appropriate&quot;. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=9m30s&quot;&gt;more questionable scene&lt;/a&gt; involved 
					English teachers perform human sacrifice. Deep Throat tells me that 
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					The big piece of censorship was that of the english department scene&lt;br/&gt;
					they were against the pentagram and the rope around the neck (not because there was any resemblence of a noose)&lt;br/&gt;
					Their reasoning was that it was &quot;too violent&quot;
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Now, putting aside that in my view, human sacrifice is actually less horrific than what goes on at my English class on a daily basis, it's unclear 
					what was so violent. First of all, an earlier scene that involved a student being stabbed to death was not cut, nor was a later scene where one 
					of the heroes is killed with a stapler, and if they were controversial, not a single source told me. Secondly, we're high school students! Keeping 
					with the theme of the English department, every student at our school reads &lt;i&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/i&gt; in freshman year, and some read 
					the famous holocaust novel &lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt;. More importantly, the scene was not a dark scene, it's just funny. In a very eloquent letter to the 
					administration, Deep Throat pointed out this out, citing the lighting and the lack of any kind of violence. Unfortunately, for security reasons, 
					I cannot quote from this letter, but suffice to say, Deep Throat made his point very well and is a much better writer than I am.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					However, the most widely cited complaint against the administration's handling of the pep rally video was the timing of their edits. According to 
					Deep Throat, the administration told the movie team to cut the scene with the 'transphobic' tank top literally the day before the pep rally, 
					despite the fact that the administration had seen the video, including that part, already - &lt;b&gt;three times&lt;/b&gt;. When I asked the 
					administration about this, they responded,
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					I appreciate the time and energy that was put into the production of the video and do apologize 
					if I was not clear from the start about the revision process and the possibility of cuts throughout. In overseeing the video screening process, 
					I tried to find a balance between the students' goal of entertaining their target audience and my responsibility of ensuring a safe environment 
					for all students and staff.
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					While the response is quite polite, I can't help but notice that the administration never actually apologized for getting the last few cuts in really,
					really late. Also, I'm not sure how most of the cut scenes would have endangered students. The biggest threat I see was that of offending Wiccan students 
					(Administration: Please don't get any ideas!), a crime of which I have been guilty of in the past.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;A Brief Mention of Wordplay Involving Reproductive Anatomy&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					A final issue that bears mentioning was the pronunciation of a particular student's name. The name was pronounced as it is in Canada, which happens to rhyme 
					with a part of the female anatomy... Oh, screw euphemisms - I, for one, think that high schoolers can deal with sexual themes. The name &quot;Regina&quot; was, on 
					one occasion, pronounced with a long 'i', which is the Canadian pronunciation. This was done not to show solidarity with our Canadian brothers and 
					sisters but for comic relief, to rhyme with &quot;Vagina&quot;. (I'd like to apologise to both the school administration and 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/06/14/155059849/michigan-state-rep-barred-from-speaking-after-vagina-comments&quot;&gt;
					the Republican wing of the Michigan state house&lt;/a&gt; for acknowledging a body part possessed by fully half of human beings.) This particular student has been 
					called Regina with a long 'i' since freshman year, so many students considered the censorship somewhat silly.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;The Trebel Rebels&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Aside from the video itself, the main issue that bears mentioning is the repertoire of the Treble Rebels, the group best known
					for providing our school with its second-worst musical pun. For those who are unaware, the Treble Rebels are
					one of the three a Capella groups at our high school. The Rebels had been practicing the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc&quot;&gt;Rehab&lt;/a&gt;, by 
					the late Amy Winehouse, for most of this year. However, they did not end up performing it at the pep rally. The exact details of why are contested - every 
					source I spoke to told me the same story. The administration decided that the Rebels couldn't perform &lt;i&gt;Rehab&lt;/i&gt;, saying that it encouraged drug use, but didn't
					tell them this until two days before. After the rally, the administration claimed that they had told the Treble Rebels about this two weeks in advance. One of 
					my sources suggested that the administration didn't know about the Rebels' song choice until a week before the rally. Despite the fact that this seems absurd, 
					my investigations suggest that, in fact, this roughly what happened.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					I contacted the school administration and asked for details regarding the Treble Rebels incident. Mrs. C-A responded with an explanation that makes sense and
					does not implicate anyone. She says that a meeting was held with the Senior student leaders on October 23rd in which the itinerary was discussed and the administration 
					laid out standards for what constituted &quot;appropriate&quot;. However, the administration never met directly with the Rebels, and somehow, the information that the Rebels
					were singing &lt;i&gt;Rehab&lt;/i&gt; didn't make it to Mrs. C-A until November 24th, two days before the rally. She immediately forbade them from singing it. 
					So the Rebels are telling the truth when they say that they were only told two days before the rally, but Dr. Pizzi is also telling the truth because he's referring 
					to the October 23rd meeting. While it's nice to know that this was an accidental misunderstand, I noted again that Mrs. C-A never really apologized for anything 
					in this message either.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					According to an anonymous source within the Rebels, the group is outraged that they were forbidden from singing &lt;i&gt;Rehab&lt;/i&gt;. My source told me
					that she found is strange that the Rebels were forbidden to sing &lt;i&gt;Rehab&lt;/i&gt;, while the Bomb Squad were allowed to &quot;shake their butts to 
					&lt;i&gt;Anaconda&lt;/i&gt;. For those who are not aware, the Bomb Squad is not our school's official terrorist group - that would be the 
					[club name here]. From what I can gather, the Bomb Squad is essentially the black cheerleading team. Why we have a separate black cheerleading
					team in 2014 is simply beyond me. &lt;i&gt;Anaconda&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of sounds by Nicki Minaj that, for reasons I cannot fathom, is sometimes mistaken for music. As research for
					this article, I listened to &lt;i&gt;Anaconda&lt;/i&gt; - do not worry, I expect the bleeding from my ears to subside shortly. I can definitely see
					what the Rebels meant about a double standard.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Confession: I wrote those jokes before I had actually listened to the song - good thing too, the only thing I can say now is &quot;Jesus fucking christ, this kind
					of shit exists?&quot; There is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTHING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in that collection of discordant sounds that is school appropriate. My earlier reaction of &quot;I can definately see
					what the Rebels meant about a double standard.&quot; doesn't cut it. There aren't words for what a double standard this is. Wow.
				&lt;p&gt;
					Other students have also expressed anger at the administration's decision to censor the Rebels. A classmate who, while he never
					technically declined to be named, I suspect would prefer anonymity, told me that &quot;If the administration submitted their interpretation
					of &lt;i&gt;Rehab&lt;/i&gt; to Freshman Honors English (For those who are not aware, at our school, 'Honors' means 'Standard; I haven't the faintest
					clue why), they &lt;b&gt;might&lt;/b&gt; just manage a passing grade.&quot; I have to agree here - the decision to censor &lt;i&gt;Rehab&lt;/i&gt; was silly - I have no idea why they thought
					this was a good idea.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;The Rally&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Everyone who attended the pep rally knows what happened there. The video was shown - heavily censored and with the ending cut off entirely - and the student body 
					responded. The chants of &quot;Bullshit! Bullshit!&quot; (One of my sources reports &quot;push it! push it!&quot;, but I remember &quot;Bullshit!&quot;) clearly offended the administration. 
					Following the return from thanksgiving break, the administration responded. I contacted Dr. Pizzi and requested a transcript of his announcement, but apparently 
					no transcript exists. Dr. Pizzi did, however, kindly summarize what he said in the announcement. He summarized the messages as
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					&lt;ul&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Much of the beginning of the pep rally was very positive.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Despite our best planning efforts, as the rally went on, the behavior of many students - mostly spectators and some participants - became egregious to the 
						point of defiling our NHS home and violating our core values.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Consequently, the professional staff and I would be taking a deep and 
						detailed look at the purpose, function, and existence of the pep rally in its current form to determine the future of the rally as a positive aspect of life at NHS.
						&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					I remember the speech as being slightly more condescending tone, but the message seems consistent. In the weeks following the pep rally, the administration 
					held multiple meetings. Throughout the various meetings, Dr. Pizzi made it clear that there would be no more pep rally videos, describing the subject as 
					&quot;non-negotiable&quot;. He has not, however, made this clear to the general public or to me in our correspondences. This is not to say that everyone in the school 
					doesn't already know that the pep rally videos are at an end - they do - but it would be nice if Dr. Pizzi had said this outright.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					By all accounts the end of the videos is not, for the most part, a result of the incident this year. Deep Throat, TJW, and Hobbes have all told me that 
					Dr. Pizzi has wanted to get rid of the pep rally video for years. Whether this year's kerfuffle was the last straw or an excuse is anyone's guess, but I 
					do wish that Dr. Pizzi had told us all this openly.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					When I contacted Dr. Pizzi for his opinion, he told me that. When I first asked Dr. Pizzi for a statement about the pep rally, he responded with this:
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					[E]very student activity - including the pep rally - must be and uplifting and respectful display of school spirit for each and every member of the school
					community. When that is not the case, we need to examine the activity and its purpose to ensure that it aligns with our core values. This is exactly what the 
					professional staff and I will do with the pep rally moving forward.
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that he took the time to respond, but I have trouble finding any real meaning in that statement through all the buzzwords.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Cultural Proficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					The recent years have seen the emergence of a new buzzword: &quot;Cultural Proficiency&quot;. The Administration's goal of fostering Cultural Proficiency is hampered 
					by the fact that no one is entirely sure what cultural proficiency actually means. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aafp.org/patient-care/public-health/cultural-proficiency.html&quot;&gt;
					American Association of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, whose website is the first result for a Google search of &quot;Cultural Proficiency&quot;, gives the following definition of 
					'Cultural Proficiency':
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Cultural proficiency is the knowledge, skills, and attitudes and beliefs that enable people to work well with, respond effectively to,
					and be supportive of people in cross-cultural settings.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					However, while this definition does seem accurate - it meshes well with the other Google results - 
					it doesn't seem to fit with the administration's policies regarding the pep rally. According to Deep Throat, &quot;okay well the admin is
					against to things: sexual innuendos and drug references or at least that's what was communicated to me at first [...] however, 
					this has extended to other areas as well they were also against any quips about specific individuals.&quot; Deep Throat kindly 
					gave me this email that ze received from Mrs. C-A, where she listed the things that had to be cut from the video. For 
					security reasons, I can't quote the email directly. Deep Throat was told to, among other things, delete any 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=6m45s&quot;&gt;comments or jokes relating to Dr. Pizzi's stature&lt;/a&gt;, delete 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=7m10s&quot;&gt;the joke about Regina's name&lt;/a&gt;, delete or heavily change 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=9m30s&quot;&gt;the English department scene&lt;/a&gt;,
					and &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=8m24s&quot;&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=12m31s&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=15m49s&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=16m15s&quot;&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=25m25s&quot;&gt;or&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/YrRkDkHubLw?t=31m2s&quot;&gt;students&lt;/a&gt;.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					From what I can tell, none of these things have anything to do with 'cultural proficiency'. I am, as always, open to 
					listening to an explanation from the administration, but it seems that the administration doesn't know what 'cultural proficiency' 
					means either.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					The scene with the male student in a tank top makes &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; more sense from a &quot;cultural proficiency&quot; standpoint, but the 
					cut has been universally seen as hypersensitive. As I myself am not transgender, I contacted a friend who blogs about her 
					experience as an MTF transgender high-school student at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thetransteen.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;The Trans Teen&lt;/a&gt;. After I 
					showed her the video and asked her opinion, she responded,
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					i dont see the issue&lt;br/&gt;
					like people are allowed to wear what they want to wear&lt;br/&gt;
					if they're not trans then it's called &quot;crossdressing&quot;
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Deep Throat said that &quot;i understand the reasoning, even though that wasn't the intent of the joke&quot;, but zir bigger complaint 
					was that, as I already mentioned, this edit came the day before the rally. Despite zir ambivalence about the 'transphobic' 
					scene being cut, Deep Throat told me that 'cultural proficiency' was the crux of the matter. 
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					i feel like the big issue is that these administrators, who are decent people, are more focused on the threat of lawsuits 
					or possibly offending someone than the wellbeing of the actual students&lt;br/&gt;
					this applies to what happened with the treble rebels&lt;br/&gt;
					it's almost as if the admin. cares more about that hypothetical freshman who 
					has laywers for parents and most likely doesn't exist than actual students
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;A Senior Show&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					My two main sources in the Student Government both told me that a major problem with the pep rally is that Dr. Pizzi thinks 
					it's currently a &quot;Senior show&quot;, and wants to change that. Hobbes added that &quot;Dr. Pizzi hates that it is a 'senior show' Though 
					even underclass men I talk to acknowledge that that is kind of the point&quot;. I have a different take; in my view, the calls for 
					&quot;inclusiveness&quot; are undermined by the fact that, if it isn't a senior show, the Pep Rally is centered on the football team. 
					While a celebration of sports at our school would not be objectionable, it seems strange that the administration has chosen 
					to focus so heavily on what may be the single most destructive behavior practiced by students at this school. I'm not going 
					to go into my full football rant (If you want to learn more - and you should - watch 
					&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/league-of-denial/&quot;&gt;League of Denial&lt;/a&gt;. It's well worth your time),
					but even putting aside the dangers of football, it is by no means the most successful sport at 
					our school. I don't know the exact numbers, but many of our teams - f&amp;uacute;tbol in particular, routinely do better than 
					the football team. If viewed exclusively through the context of athletics, as Dr. Pizzi apparently wishes, the pep rally is 
					almost exclusively a celebration of football. I, for one, would prefer a &quot;senior show&quot; - a time to say, &quot;This is who we are.
					This is our culture. This is where we've been together, and we're all better people from this journey.&quot;
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Anger at the Administration&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Whatever the causes of the pep rally debacle, there is one thing that the student body and the administration can agree on: 
					The student body is pissed. Hashemi, who was very prominent in the video, said &quot;That they haven't censored these types
					of things in the past, we came up with and have been exposed to these types of jokes before and they're eliminating them 
					from the video isn't going to shelter us from that.&quot; 
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Don Mahogany, a student council member who was fine with me using his name, said that &quot;I'm extremely disappointed in 
					the administration's response to the pep rally. I thought that Pizzi telling the student body that they had displayed 
					a profound lack of cultural proficiency was extremely offensive and alienating. I understand why the administration 
					is upset. But their solution to the problem is turning the entire student body against them which sucks for everyone.&quot;
					Hobbes said that &quot;It doesn't feel like they appreciate our point of view or concerns&quot;, which seems to me to be a very
					good summary of how the student body feels at the moment. Hobbes told me that the pep rally incident is indicative of
					a larger problem. &quot;overall,&quot; he told me, &quot;there are lots of instances of administrators talking with kids who are in 
					trouble, sometimes over made up rules (I am thinking of a case where someone told me of athletes getting suspended for
					actions that, in the handbook, weren't among the specified actions that led to suspensions), and hardly allow the 
					student to speak for themsleves&quot;  
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Deep Throat connected the administration's over-sensitivity with an incident a few months ago where Student News aired 
					a humorous piece poking fun at the freshman class (I would post a link, but it's been pulled from the website) It was
					by far the funniest thing ever to come out of Student News that did not involve Aaron Traylor. From what I can gather, 
					the administration went ballistic. Deep Throat said of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/8hEwgxFPYIs?t=9s&quot;&gt;desperate apology&lt;/a&gt;,
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote&gt;
					it was a result of faculty members who thought the freshman would feel left out&lt;br/&gt;
					more than that. they thought it was actually destructive&lt;br/&gt;
					and as a result, the creator of that segment, [name redacted] (a really sweet kid) was almost demonized&lt;br/&gt;
					her work was described as hateful&lt;br/&gt;
					and i doubt a single freshman card
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					The whole Student News debacle - the harmless joking, administration freakout, and overactive apology - symbolizes the 
					problem of over-sensitivity at our school. Without question, it is important that our school be a safe environment where 
					no one is harassed or bullied. But if school is actually supposed to prepare us for real life, it can't try shield us 
					from everything. Everyone sometimes hears statements that are somewhat offensive, but at some point, the burden falls 
					on the recipient to shrug it off. The freshmen seem to have done just that regarding the Student News segment; I 
					encourage the administration to follow their lead.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					But over-sensitivity is not the entire problem. The administration doesn't respect the student body, and if we are to 
					have a truly productive environment, they have to see things from our point of view, just as I have tried to see 
					things from theirs. The condescending attitude with which the administration interacts 
					with the student body is perhaps best illustrated by this: In my interactions with the administration, they have stated
					that they 'regret' some things, or that things are 'unfortunate', or apologized for failing to make it &quot;clear from the start  
					about the revision process and the possibility of cuts throughout&quot;, but never once have they actually apologized for their various
					screwups. The debacle surrounding the pep rally, and the administration's response, have created what 
					Hobbes referred to as an &quot;us-versus-them mentality&quot;.  Call me a romantic, but I don't think it has to be this way. 
					Meet us in the middle, respect us, and the administration might find that they have a lot to gain.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I'd like to close with something that Hobbes said.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
					In the end the goal of pep rally is to get the whole school united over a athletics&lt;br/&gt;
					This year the uniting was done against administration&lt;br/&gt;
					&lt;b&gt;And that's not the kind of atmosphere anyone really wants&lt;/b&gt;
				&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<Title>School Administration Slams Winterfest for 'Misogyny', 'Lack of Cultural Proficiency'</Title>

		<Text>
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Winterfest concert held yesterday by the RHS String Orchestra, Band, and choral groups&lt;/span&gt; provoked a backlash from the school administration, who
			complained that the music performed was &quot;misogynistic&quot; and demonstrated a &quot;saddening lack of cultural proficiency&quot;. The music performed jointly by the
			String Orchestra and Chorale took most of the flak. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The first piece put on was 'I'll Make a Man Out Of You' from Disney's &lt;i&gt;Mulan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which the administration
			slammed for being 'misogynistic'. &quot;The association of masculinity with superior qualities such as strength and courage is something that we do not want to
			see anywhere at this school,&quot; school Political Correctness Supervisor Kristen Geraldstein wrote on the RHS website. &quot;It saddens me that we have this far to go.&quot;
			Speaking about the second objectionable song, &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;'Holding Out for a Hero' by Bonnie Tyler,&lt;/span&gt; Ms. Geraldstein said, &quot;The idea that a woman needs a man to save her
			belongs in the 20th, no, the 19th century. It's offensive to see the perpetuation of negative stereotypes and our school - I thought our students were better than this.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
			The administration has stated that, due to Ms. Geraldstein's objections, the student body will not be allowed to hold Winterfest next year. &lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			UPDATE: After discovering that the Winterfest repertoire was laid out by school staff, Ms. Geraldstein amended her statement. It now reads, in its entirety, &quot;Eh, whatever.&quot;

		<Title>Ebola Stokes Fear in Vampire Community</Title>

		<Text>
			As Ebola continues to rampage through west Africa and the first cases are encountered in America, terror has engulfed many people
			who, reasonably speaking, have no chance whatsoever of contracting the disease. However, the panic has been especially bad in the one
			American community truly menaced by Ebola: Vampires. "To most, the phrase 'transmitted only by contact with bodily fluids' is reassuring",
			Vampire spokeswoman and bored person Kristen Stewart told News from Rockettopia, "but for vampires, it merely adds to the terror." Vampires
			in west Africa have been dealing with this problem for months now, and there have been some reports in recent weeks of vampires starving
			to death rather than risking a slow, painful end by Ebola. As of yet, there have been no reports of such extreme action here in America,
			but the vampire community is nonetheless taking precautions, such as securing community borders and hoarding food. To quote Kristen Stewart, 
			"While Ebola is a threat, it's not time to panic
			yet. I personally believe that the spread of Ebola in the United States can be contained to Texas and the bordering states. But we're
			still very worried. In addition to causing almost certain death, Ebola patients taste terrible." (For your sanity, we have chosen to
			omit Stewart's detailed description of what constituted "terrible") We here at News from Rockettopia would like to extend our good
			wishes to the Vampire community in these dark times. We also have a list of people who we know are clean. &lt;br/&gt;
			In related news, the entire population of Forks, Washington has vanished under mysterious circumstances. Carslile Cullen could not be
			reached for comment.

		<Title>Vacationers Canceling Trips to Alaska to Avoid Mexican Drug War</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>Global</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;As the outrage and chaos continues in Mexico after the kidnapping of forty-three students last month&lt;/span&gt;, concerned travelers have begun to
			cancel scheduled trips to Alaska. Despite the assurances of various public leaders that Alaska is sufficiently far away from Mexico that it is not threatened by
			the Mexican political strife, travelers have opted to 'take it safe' and avoid the entire north American continent. &quot;So &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;it's thirty-two hundred miles from Mexico
			City to Juneau&lt;/span&gt;.&quot; a nervous traveler told us, &quot;I still don't think it's safe to get near something so dangerous.&quot; When we asked an agent from the travel
			planning company Travelocity, he told us, &quot;It's completely absurd. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Alaska is separated from the Mexican unrest by both the mainland United States and Canada, neither
			of which have recently had any outbreaks of local civil war&lt;/span&gt;. Just because &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;the mayor of Iguala [A town near Mexico City] sold 43 college students
			into slavery to a drug gang, which resulted in him becoming a fugitive, rioters burning down the Iguala city hall and attempting to burn down the state capitol building, and
			the governor resigning - just because that happened doesn't mean that Alaska is unsafe&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;b&gt;IT'S THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED F**KING MILES.&lt;/b&gt; We have fact-checked his statement and,
			although we have been unable to substantiate his claim that the distances between Mexico and Alaska are engaging in sexual intercourse, his sentiment seems accurate.
			There is no outstanding danger to visiting Alaska right now - although, given the season, the trip might be a little sub-par.&lt;br/&gt;
			We would also like to take this opportunity to warn our readers against traveling to Africa. Remember, Johannesburg, South Africa is only thirty-three hundred miles from
			Monrovia, the center of the Ebola outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;

		<Text>
			After &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;his four-minute rant about the media sensationalism and fearmongering around Ebola&lt;/span&gt;, Shepard Smith was fired from Fox News yesterday.
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;On live television, Smith gave viewers an accurate picture of Ebola and explained to them why it was not an immanent danger&lt;/span&gt;, displaying
			a sense of level-headedness and sanity that flies in the face of the Fox lack-of-ethics policy. According to the Fox News release,
			Fox CEO Roger Ailes began personally drawing up Smith's release papers around the point when &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Smith began defending the Obama administration's
			coverage of Ebola, saying that the party not in power &quot;needs to show that there is a lack of leadership&quot;&lt;/span&gt;. As &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Smith continued his heresy by saying that
			there was &quot;no evidence of any kind of which we at Fox News are aware that leaders have lied about anything regarding Ebola.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, the staff began panicking.
			By the time &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Smith told the viewers that &quot;If that fact 
			changes, our reporting will change.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, the memo was complete. Smith's spot in the broadcast schedule will be filled by the new 'Screaming in Terror Show'.
			CNN spoke out in a press release condemning Smith's levelheaded reporting, saying, &quot;While reporting facts in a reasonable manner, Mr. Smith has forgotten
			the true purpose of journalism: to boost ratings.&quot;

		<Title>Instead of Building Suspense, Blogger Just Being Annoying</Title>

		<Text>
			A special report released today by the Institute for Overly Meta Content strongly suggested that, by releasing 
			cryptic hints about &quot;Something big&quot;, a local blogger was, instead of building suspense, just being annoying. The
			Institute found that &lt;span class=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;cryptic and nondescript posts about a &quot;major project&quot; and strange animated clips posted to
			Facebook&lt;/span&gt; did not make the blogger's hypothetical fans anxious to see what comes next; instead, it just pisssed them
			off. As one local put it, &quot;He keeps dropping these little clues, but no one has any idea what they mean. I wish he
			would either give details or shut up!&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
			When we contacted the blogger via mirror and asked for comment, he simply replied, &quot;You'll find out soon enough.&quot; What a dick.

		<Text>
			As ethnic tensions continued to rise across the region, president Obama spoke out on the current clashes in Missouri earlier today, 
			saying that the United States cannot, on its own, bring peace to the United States. Speaking at a press confrence on the White House lawn,
			Obama reenforced his previously established positions on ethnic conflicts in the third world. &quot;What is happening in America right now
			is tragic. A minority ethnic group has experienced great oppression by the majority group, and this needs to stop. But the United States
			cannot intervene in every world crisis, and this conflict is one that I'm going to have to keep us out of. The two communities in Ferguson,
			and their extensions throughout the country, have had clashes and tensions for over five hundred years, and there is nothing that America
			can do to solve that. The people of the United States are going to have to sort this out on their own.&lt;/br&gt;
			Senator John McCain responded to the presidents comments by requesting air strikes on Ferguson, but was unwilling to specify which group
			would be the target.

		<Title>Tragic Case of Military Brutality Sparks Anger, Controversy</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Racism</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Protests, anger, and yelling were sparked earlier this week after a teenage member of a majority ethnic group was brutally gunned down by
			a member of the majority. The teenager, who was a member of the local 'blaak' group, which is a majority in the region, was shot repeatedly
			by a militiaman despite being unarmed and unthreatening. The soldier's 'huite' community composes only a third of the village of
			Furgusonne, where the shooting took place, but controls the entire local government and militia. By all accounts, the huites,
			despite being thousands of miles from the nearest war zone, have armed their forces with automatic rifles and military vehicles. After the 
			teenager was killed, his body was allowed to lie on the road for four hours before it was removed. The casual brutality of the entire incident
			has sparked protests throughout Furgusonne, which the huite militia crushed using tear gas and rubber bullets. Multiple American journalists
			have also been arrested and detained in blatant violation of freedom of the press, which is considered a basic right in the democratic world.&lt;br/&gt;
			The shooting, despite its brutality, has only served to illustrate the huites' suppression of the blaaks, who make up only 13% of the country's
			overall population. In most areas, the huites compose a disproportionate majority of the law enforcement, and in many cases this leads to implicit
			or explicit targeting of the blaaks or other minority groups. In most cases, this takes the form of discriminatory searches of innocent civilians,
			but it often goes as far as beatings, arbitrary arrests, excessive uses of force, and, in a disturbing number of cases, shootings like the one
			in Furgusonne. Huites governments, which is to say most governments, as huites are disproportionately represented in politics, have often begun to
			make laws that covertly prevent blaaks and other minorities from voting. They have been assisted in this by the country's highest court, which
			recently gutted a key law that protected blaak voting rights.
			Although the blaak community undertook a massive push for equality around half a century ago, which overthrew the explicitly ethnic laws that
			existed at the time, it seems that the blaak people in Usa are still a long way from equality. The recent election of a blaak man to the
			highest office in the country six years ago has given hope to many, but some huites have taken it to mean that the ethnic tensions that pervade this nation
			are at an end, which as any reader can see is glaringly false. Until the entire huite community accepts that ethnic inequalities are still
			a massive problem in Usa, this reporter fears that the terrible scourge of racism cannot be fixed.

		<Title>Rich White Men Defend Right to Work Blacks Without Pay</Title>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;A large collection of rich white men suffered a defeat today in their quest to work a group of young men, predominantly black, 
				without pay. The rich white men have established a business model that relies on making the young men do extremely strenuous physical activity for no pay. 
				The young men are made to constantly practice physical competitive skills, often to the point where they have no time for education or socializing, and are, 
				in return, provided with the bare minimum of meals and housing. The rich white men who make fortunes off the young men, claim that the young men are lucky to 
				get even the tiny meals, living quarters, and basic education.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, a judge struck a blow against the rich white men yesterday when he ruled that the rich white men do not have the right to use the young mens' likenesses
				without their consent or compensation. The rich white men are expected to fight this decision, along with any others that restrict their right to exploit young
				black men.&lt;/span&gt;

		<Title>European Space Agency Defends Harpooning of Comet by Claiming "Scientific Research"</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Science</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In a press conference earlier today, top European Space Agency (ESA) officials defended the harpooning of a comet by a ESA craft, claiming that the attack
				was for &quot;Scientific Research&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/science/space/spacecraft-pulls-alongside-comet.html?_r=0&quot;&gt; Rosetta spacecraft is scheduled to fire a harpoon into Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sometime this November, but as
				the probe pulled alongside the comet earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, the contraversity began to bubble. The ESA officials claim that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;firing a projectile into the comet to
				extract a sample&lt;/span&gt; is being done for &quot;Science&quot;, but critics point out that the agency also &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;stands to make a tidy no profit whatsoever on the mission&lt;/span&gt;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				A few dozen protesters gathered outside the NASA research center in Langley, Virginia to protest the attack on the comet. One protester told News from Rockettopia,
				&quot;Comets are ancient entities that have existed since the solar system began, and every year a few of them are lost forever. NASA should not be aiding in the extinction
				of Comets in the name of 'research'! They just want to extract the rare chemicals that the Comet contains like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and sell them back on Earth. Save
				the comets! Save the comets!&quot; This went on for some time until a frustrated NASA spokesperson walked out to make a quick press release. &quot;We wish to clarify that
				the Rosetta mission is strictly for scientific purposes, that it will not harm the comet populations, and that &lt;b&gt;WE HERE AT NASA HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT! IT'S THE
				ESA, YOU MORONS!&lt;/b&gt;&quot; He seemed very angry, muttering, &quot;Seriously, where do these idiots come from?&quot; as he stormed off. The demonstrators tell us that they have no intent
				of leaving until all of space is made safe for comets now and forever.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although the crowds protesting the harpooning of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are relatively small, many on the internet have questioned whether the various &quot;Studies&quot; that
				the Rosetta mission will perform on the dirty snowball are in any way unethical. These concerns were sparked by &lt;a href=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;a statement from astronomer Karl Battams, who
				said in an interview, &quot;Pretty much everything you could hope to do on a comet, Rosetta is going to be doing it.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Although scientists have refused to elaborate on
				what the Rosetta lander will be doing to the comet except &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta&quot;&gt;on their website, on the internet,
				where anyone can access it&lt;/a&gt;, many believe that the mission may violate international norms regarding cruelty to comets. &quot;We haven't figured out yet how
				to communicate with comets,&quot; said one person on the internet who, for some reason, we think is worth mentioning. &quot;Until we do, we don't know if this unnatural
				'Rosetta Lander' is violating the comet's desires.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite the bad press, the ESA has refused to alter its plans to fire the harpoon into the comet sometime in November, causing absolutely no damage to
				this majestic inanimate object just to revolutionize our view of the solar system.

			A new study from the Rockettopia University this week showed conclusively that college students were unable to tell the difference

			the release of yet another fucking Transformers movie this week&lt;/span&gt;, firmly showed that those students who resisted writhing in pain

		<Title>Animals Without Complex Nervous Systems Such as Flatworms, Ann Coulter Still Capable of Basic Learning</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Fox News</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Studies at the Rockettopia University, which is known worldwide as a prominant player in the field of low intelligence,
				have vigorously tested previous research on unintelligent creatures such as flatworms and Ann Coulter, and come through with
				flying colors. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Planarian flatworms, simple organisms with no brain to speak of, are capable of learning 
				and remembering behaviors.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3799&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The study also 
				confirmed that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;planarians are capable of remembering things that they have learned despite having their 
				heads cut off. &lt;b&gt;Un&lt;/b&gt;like earthworms, if a planarian is cut in half, both halves will regenerate into full planarians, and 
				apparently retain their memories and learned behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Ann Coulter, by contrast, is a right-wing
				pundit and frequent Fox News contributer.&lt;/span&gt; She is also the least intelligent vertibrate ever recorded. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Coulter 
				returned to the news this week when she wrote an article condemning Football [Soccer] as a sign of America's 'moral decay'. According 
				to Coulter, &quot;If more 'Americans' are watching soccer today, it's only because of the demographic switch effected by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 
				immigration law. I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to 
				learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/stargazing/article634118.html&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;This kind of trash is 
				so irredeemably stupid that I think no explanation is necessary.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				With this recent outburst, it only makes sense that the Rockettopia University would include Coulter in their study of low intelligence, along
				with planarians, nematode worms, box jellyfish, and aomebas. Coulter was determined to be roughly on the order of the planarians in terms of
				intelligence. Scientists found that if they locked Coulter in a room and delivered a light flash followed by a strong electric shock, they would
				get a lot more funding for their research. In addition, Coulter would learn to anticipate the shock based on the light flash and blame Obama and
				liberalism for the shock even if no shock occured. The researchers state in their paper that they were originally planning to cut Ann Coulter in
				half and see if two new Ann Coulters would be formed, and if so, whether both would retain the developed association, but they decided that this
				would be horrific and unethical. According to the lead scientist, &quot;It is absolutely unacceptable to risk unleashing another Ann Coulter upon the
				innocent and unsuspecting human race. One of her is already one too many.&quot;

			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The American exchange student in Germany who became suck in a giant vagina sculpture a few days ago and had to be removed

			prank went horrible awry in a wardrobe malfunction. The student spent his college years continuing to humiliate himself, which is not really that different

		<Title>Citizens March To No Practical Purpose in Carefully Choreographed Drill</Title>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Hundreds of citizens were removed from their normal accomidations and paraded around Rockettopia today in a carefully-planned &quot;Drill&quot;, 
					the purpose of which was simply to see if it could be done. Directly before the drill, citizens were instructed to cower silently in corners, supposedly 
					to prepare for an attack by some unspecified &quot;threat&quot;. After this was complete, the officials overseeing the facility ordered the citizens to be marched out of 
					wherever they happened to be at the time and marched them to a predetermined location. Again, the citizens were ordered to be silent, and were hushed by officials 
					if they dared to speak. Once the citizens arrived at the location, they were told to group up by their current occupation, so they could be counted. Ropes prevented 
					citizens in different areas from speaking to one another.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					On a hill above the crowded field, the leader of the community watched over the exercise. Although he, his staff, the officials, and the entire government are all from a 
					minority group that makes up less than a fourteenth of the community, their fundumental right to rule is rarely questioned. The flag fluttered above him as the 
					leader, along with his closest advisors, considered the skill to which the exercise was carried out.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Once the citizens were fully counted, and the officials had confirmed that no one was absent, the citizens were ordered to march back to their accomidations
					and continue with their previous tasks. Over the loudspeakers positioned throughout the facility, the leader informed the citizens that they had performed
					well, and that the time in which they had completed the drill was impressively low. Citizens continued with their days without questioning the drill or their 
					leader.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;span style=&quot;color:white;&quot;&gt;I must give credit to my history teacher for pointing this out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;After a mentally disturbed gunman went on a shooting, stabbing, and auto homicide rampage last Friday, leaving seven dead and thirteen injured, 
				America's media	responded with a resounding &quot;Meh&quot;. Mass Murder, it seems, is no longer news. In a country which, in the last few years, has suffered shootings at 
				Newtown, Aurora, ... pause while I Google this, there are so many... MY GOD THERE ARE SO MANY I NEVER HEARD OF! ... The Sikh Temple, Seattle, Oikos University, IHOP,
				Tuscon, Fort Hood, Virginia Tech... And those are only &lt;b&gt;some&lt;/b&gt; of  only the &lt;b&gt;major&lt;/b&gt; mass shootings. Clearly, America has become accustomed to gun violence
				on a large scale, as it seems to be part of daily life now. The United States, as shown by the graph below, has far more gun deaths than any other developed country.&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2012/12/firearm-OECD-UN-data3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
				Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/14/chart-the-u-s-has-far-more-gun-related-killings-than-any-other-developed-country/&quot;&gt;
				The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				So it comes as no surprise that CNN being informed of the UCA Santa Barbra shooting sounded something like this: &quot;And now we have some breaking news from California! A
				shooting spree at UCA Santa Barbra has left seven people dead... Only seven? I thought you said this was breaking news. Sorry for the interruption - we now return to
				Malaysian Airliner search coverage...&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Political observers predict that, with the frequency of mass shootings in America, Congress will skip the normal attempts to pass commonsense gun control legislation,
				yelling, and failing to get anything done, and simply continue with (lack of) busness as usual.

		<Title>Lawsuit-Embroiled Weird Shoe Company Defends Itself; "Our Shoes Protect Against STDs"</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				After &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;settling a lawsuit claiming that they lied about the health benefits of their shoes&lt;/span&gt;, Barefoot Shoe manufacturer Vibram struck back 
				at critics by claiming that their shoes protect against sexually transmitted diseases. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Vibram had marketed its strange individual-toed shoes by 
				claiming that the shoes
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
			(1) Strengthen muscles in the feet and lower legs&lt;br /&gt;
			(2) Improve range of motion in the ankles, feet, and toes&lt;br /&gt;
			(3) Stimulate neural function important to balance and agility&lt;br /&gt;
			(4) Eliminate heel lift to align the spine and improve posture&lt;br /&gt;
			(5) Allow the foot and body to move naturally&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				But in 2012 Valerie Bezdek sued on a charge of false advertising&lt;/span&gt;, pointing out that Vibram had, to quote Bezdek, &quot;Pulled their 'science' out of their ass.&quot; 
				After checking with their science department, discovering that it consisted of five dusty mannequins in lab coats, and then checking with their marketing department,
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Vibram decided to settle with Bezdek and pay 3.75 million dollars to people who have bought their shoes.&lt;/span&gt; Wait, what? 3.75 &lt;b&gt;million&lt;/b&gt;? 
				Oh. Total. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Each person who purchased a pair of FiveFinger and can provide proof-of-purchase shoes will be eligible for a refund of approximately 50$&lt;/span&gt;.
				Vibram will not, however, compensate buyers for the emotional trauma of being mocked by the friends they had remorselessly preached the benefits of FiveFinger to. 
				The judge who ruled in the case is, however, 'leaving open' the option of forcing Vibram to compensate the people who had to listen.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Today, Vibram defended itself from accusation of lying to their customers by responding that although their shoes did not, in fact, promote any kind of foot, leg, 
				or muscle health, the shoes were incredibly effective at protecting against Sexually Transmitted Diseases. &quot;Unlike our previous assertions, which we now regret 
				and never would have made if we had thought someone would check them, science does show that FiveFinger shoes protect against sexually transmitted diseases more 
				effectively than almost any other product on the market.&quot; The spokesman then cited a study conducted by Rockettopia University earlier this year that found, in a 
				sample of nearly a million individuals, no instances of contraction of and kind of STDs by people who often wore FiveFinger shoes. The study concluded by stating 
				that, &quot;[T]he data speaks for itself. FiveFinger shoes are incredibly effective at preventing the transmission of Venereal Diseases including but not limited to 
				Gonorrhea, syphilis, and Herpes. The effect of FiveFinger on reducing STD rates equals only that of total sexual abstinence... Oh. I get it now. Maybe I should 
				get rid of these.&quot; (Behe 31)

		<Title>Donetsk, Ukraine Observes Passover By Re-Enacting Antisemitism</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				The embattled city of Donetsk, Ukraine celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover this week with the ancient tradition of antisemitism. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Someone, it's 
				currently unclear who, posted notices around the city telling Donetski Jews, &lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;All citizens of Jewish nationality over the age of 16 who live on the territory of the sovereign Donetsk Republic must before May 3, 2014, appear 
				before the Donetsk Republic commissar for nationality affairs in Room 514 of the government's offices. The cost of registration is 50 US dollars.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				That this event coincides with Passover may not be a coincidence. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Passover celebrates the legendary escape of the Jewish people from Egypt, which, 
				if historical, is the oldest case of antisemitism. Jews celebrate passover by gathering with family, praying, and eating Matzah, a kind of bread-cracker hybrid which 
				ancient antisemite tradition claims is made from the blood of Christian boys.&lt;/span&gt; However, many moderate antisemites today believe that such stories are not factually 
				correct, but merely serve to remind believers that Jews must be feared and hated. Given the long history of Judiasm, antisemitism and Passover, it only makes sense that antisemites 
				would celebrate Passover with the persecution of the Jews. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The tradition of antisemitism seen here has a rich cultural history. Archaeologists have found evidence of antisemitism dating back to hundreds of years before the birth 
				of Christ, and it has been continuously practiced to some extent ever since. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Antisemitism can range from the banning of synagogues to clothing 
				restrictions to restrictions on residence to outright massacres, and in extreme cases systematic murder.&lt;/span&gt; Some critics have condemned antisemitism for being &quot; is 
				prejudice, hatred of, or discrimination against Jews for reasons connected to their Jewish religion or heritage&quot; (Source: Wikipedia), but others respond that antisemitism 
				is a rich and diverse culture that should not be painted with one brush.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				One such person is Artem Oleksiy, an official of the self-declared Donetsk Republic. &quot;We have a long tradition of antisemitism.&quot;, he told News from Rockettopia. &quot;This 
				new requirement that Jews register with the government is simply an expression of our rich cultural heritage. We are proud to be bigots.&quot; When asked if the Jew 
				Registration Drive would lead to the establishment of ghettos, voting restrictions, and laws about Jewish-owned businesses, Oleksiy dismissed such claims nonchalantly. 
				&quot;Absurd. Those plans are not to be released to the public for three months yet.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>AGSA Should Not Have Kept Quiet About Day of Silence</Title>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The student body awoke last Friday to discover that it was the national &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dayofsilence.org&quot;&gt;Day
				of Silence&lt;/a&gt;. The Day of Silence, which is organized locally by the AGSA (All Genders and Sexualities Alliance), is a day on which participants 
				keep silent to protest the social pressures that make GLBTQ teens stay silent about who they are. Unfortunately, this year the AGSA did not talk 
				to the school beforehand about the day of silence. So when Friday 4/11 arrived, the student body was caught off-guard. Many would-be participants 
				were forced to speak because they had not been able to fill out the paperwork in time. To be absolutely clear, yes, I am saying that at Rockettopia 
				High School, one must fill out paperwork days in advance just to be allowed to shut up.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although supporter badges were available at the doors, and many students wore them&lt;/span&gt;, many have spoken out encouraging the AGSA to talk to the student 
				body about the Day of Silence next year.

		<Title>Ryan Proposes New Budget; Likely More Campaign Tool Than Legislation</Title>

			House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan today announced that he would be attempting to propose an updated version of his trademark budget
			proposal this Wednesday. Ryan's budget will cut taxes radically for the rich, increase defense spending, cut Medicaid, and, of course, repeal the 
			Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. The budget proposal is strange in that it has no chance of passing the Democrat-controlled Senate,
			and that Ryan-Murray budget, which Chairman Ryan drafted with senator Patty Murray last year, makes a budget proposal this year unnecessary. More 
			likely, Ryan's new budget is a campaigning tool that the GOP will use to rally their voter base in preparation for the midterm elections this
			November. &lt;br/&gt; Source: NPR

		<Title>RHS Addiction Task Force Going After 2048</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Rockettopia High School administration announced today that they would be forming a task force to go after the highly addictive game 2048.
				Since it was published less than a month ago, 2048 has achieved a large following among everyone on the Internet. The decision to go after 2048 came
				after a new study by the RHS Studying-Things Club found that 'playing 2048' is now the number one use of school computers, beating out the previous
				front-runners, 'watching porn' and 'using them as bongs'. &quot;&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;This logic-skill-building game 2048 has been wasting vital time that
				students could be using to do something productive like write an essay over-analyzing The Bean Trees.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, the Principal told News from Rockettopia.
				&quot;It must be stopped.&quot; We here at News from Rockettopia are glad to see the administration switching its focus from marijuana to something actually
				addictive. Now, must... play... 2048. I'm sure I can spare just one more night's sleep!

		<Title>School Musical Message: Repression is For Your Own Good</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Rockettopia High School production of Urinetown last weekend was stunningly successful. The performance was carried by amazing actors,
				skilled set design, a hardworking crew,&lt;/span&gt; and the overarching message that repression is for your own good.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt; For those not familiar
				with the musical, Urinetown is the story of a town in which all toilets are controlled by the Urine Good Company (UGC) and charge admission fees. Those
				who cannot pay the fees are executed. Eventually, a popular revolt deposes the dictatorial leaders of the UGC and make toilets free. And then they all 
				die when the water runs out. &lt;/span&gt; Because what were they supposed to do, build outhouses or composting toilets or something?
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The underlying theme
				that the musical is intended to convey, according to the director, is that &quot;However bad the authority's treatment of you may seem, however arbitrary and
				oppressive their rules, they're looking out for your own good and you should just go along with it.&quot; The obvious application of this message in everyday
				life is in marijuana. &quot;We crack down on anyone who we catch with marijuana,&quot; the RHS principal told News from Rockettopia, &quot;and we don't give a good reason
				why except that it's for some reason illegal and you should just do what we tell you. Our production of Urinetown was intended to drive home the message that
				these kinds of rules are for your own good, that you can't be expected to understand what they're for, that it's right to deal harshly with those who disobey
				or question, and that if you don't do as we say, bad things will happen.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>RHSN Screws Up School Musical Information, Still Better than CNN</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite the many screw-ups in the Rockettopia High School News coverage of the school musical, their coverage is still better than most of CNN, according
				to the Media Analysis Agency. The report, which was delivered today and represented a change from 'boring and stupid' to 'boring, stupid, and inaccurate', 
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;began with footage of chairs in what was may have been the wrong auditorium and and peaked when the voice-over claimed that the performance
				was by the charity group Students Acting to Make a Difference. While SAMD is a great charity, it is not in fact interchangeable with Rockettopia High School,&lt;/span&gt;
				as the narrator of that segment will probably learn a few minutes before he is fired.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although the coverage was terrible, it was still better than CNN, said the MAA.
				RHSN, after all, has never sent two reporters to talk to each other from the same parking lot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-may-8-2013/the-standlot&quot;&gt;which
				really happened I'm serious&lt;/a&gt;. When the musical, Urinetown, is performed this weekend at the Neumann School Auditorium, we will cover it here at News from Rockettopia,
				but everyone should still go see what we assume, admittedly based on no evidence, will be an amazing production.

			Despite the fact that, as of this writing, the Oscars that people actually care about such as Best Picture, Best Animated Picture, Best Actor, and Best Actress

			&lt;p&gt;
				School authorities are scratching their heads after &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;mysterious posters appeared around Rockettopia High School this Monday. The posters, 
				which appear to satirize school-authorized anti-marijuana posters, feature a cynical image, a &lt;/span&gt;masterfully&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt; faked approval stamp, and a link
				to a certain blog that some of our readers may have heard of.&lt;/span&gt; We at News from Rockettopia want to make it clear that we have no idea where these disruptive and
				subversive posters originated, and in no way had this article already written before the posters appeared. We hope that the pranksters behind this are brought to justice
				soon, but they would seem to be far to intelligent and devious to be caught. Below is an image of the poster that is without question a photograph:

			&lt;p&gt;
				(2/13/2014) The National Weather Service just announced today that they predict the current blizzard to end by the year 2017. Snow will likely begin to taper off
				sometime in late 2015, but heavy snowfall may continue in bursts until mid 2016. By 2017, the NWS guarantees that schools will be able to re-open. The head of the national
				weather service released a statement from his car, where he is currently trapped, saying, &quot;The delay of all activities for three years due to snow is certainly unfortunate
				and inconvenient, but on the other hand, we don't have to deal with 2016 election campaigns, so it's a mixed blessing.

		<Title>School Staff Somehow Manages To Screw Up Propaganda Posters</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Rockettopia High School administration continued to demonstrate its ability to bungle even the most basic tasks earlier this week when it was
				discovered that they had somehow managed to screw up a simple 'Say-No-To-Drugs' poster. The poster, which attempted to inform students that eight out of ten students
				don't smoke pot, would have been simply ignored by everyone if it hadn't contained the cryptic message &quot;Fun Fact: The Hawaiian alphabet has twelve letters!&quot;. The message 
				appeared in tiny letters&lt;/span&gt;, and was so strange and out-of-place that the only people who would be interested were those already high, which may have been the point.
				But, as it was discovered this week, the crimes of the administration go beyond attempting to stop students from smoking pot: &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Hawaiian alphabet
				actually has eighteen letters and eleven diphthongs&lt;/span&gt;, whatever the hell those are.
			&lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;
				I will pause here while those of you who are stoned muse about the word 
				'diphthong' for five minutes.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				...
				&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				It's not quite clear how the RHS poster-makers screwed this one up; &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;a simple Google search of 'Hawaiian alphabet'
				quickly redirects one to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_alphabet&quot;&gt;this Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;, which explains the proper number of letters and diphthongs...&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Do we have to do this again?&lt;br/&gt;
				Fine...&lt;br/&gt;
				...&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				in the Hawaiian alphabet. Whatever the cause, we here at News from Rockettopia demand that this error be corrected
				at once! We want our administration's propaganda to contain no irrelevant lies. Only relevant ones.

				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported today that a new Kickstarter project that claims to be raising money &quot;To hire an assassin or
				assassins to kill the entire Geico marketing company.&quot; The Kickstarter is capitalizing on anger over Geico's new talking painting commercials, which are, according to
				#TehAnnoyingThingsResearchInstitute, one of the most annoying things ever created by mankind. Over half of the five million dollar goal has been raised via Kickstarter
				in the two days since the project began. Prominent donors include Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mitt Romney, Carlos Slim, Tom Hanks, Kim Kardashian, and literally every
				person who has ever seen the ads.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Earlier today, Kickstarter released an official statement on the ads. &quot;Our website is intended to raise money for startups, not
				non-profits, and in addition we oppose mass murder as a company policy.&quot; They went on to say, &quot;However, we took a look at those Geico ads, and on second thought, we're
				not going to interfere just this once. Now excuse me, I need to go donate more money to those freedom fighters.&quot;

		<Title>Facebook Continues Campaign to Become Abandoned and Obsolete</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Social Media giant Facebook today &lt;del&gt;warned&lt;/del&gt; announced that this Thursday would see an escalation of its running campaign to slip into obsolescence.
				The campaign, code-named &quot;Operation MySpace&quot;, began with the introduction of &quot;Sponsored Stories&quot; in 2011 and has escalated continuously ever since. When News from
				Rockettopia asked an employee, who declined to be named, about the campaign, she told us: &quot;I was involved in Operation MySpace from the beginning. We thought that 
				'Sponsored Stories', you know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbergus.com/2012/02/how-i-became-amazons-pitchman-for-a-55-gallon-drum-of-personal-lubricant-on-facebook/&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;
				making unsuspecting customers into spokespeople for 55-gallon barrels of lube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, would do the trick, but they just kept coming!&quot; A weapon of mass frustration was launched
				later that year with the timeline bug feature, which persists to this day despite calls by everyone, ever, to remove it. Facebook continued the campaign into 2012 with
				the introduction of mobile ads to clog up smartphone screens and hopefully drive customers away to Twitter, Tumblr, or Pintrest. And all this time, Facebook made it
				very clear that they would sell any personal information on a user to any client with the money.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&quot;Quite frankly, I'm surprised that there's anyone still on Facebook
				at this point,&quot;, our informant told us. &quot;I would think that at this point they'd be desperate enough to go to Google+ if need be, but we seem to have underestimated the power
				of brand loyalty. But we haven't given up yet.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Facebook hopes that their new autoplaying video ads in users' newsfeeds and the taunting launch of the dislike button only
				for private messages will manage to disgust their customer base enough to end Facebook's run as a top Social Networking site. Our contact, however, is skeptical. &quot;If we haven't
				managed to drive away every man, woman, and child on Earth by now, there's no hope. We'll try, but nothing could possibly break Facebook except turning off every server in
				the world. That or an influx of parents.&quot;

		<Title>Study Shows 2013 Not Over Yet</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				A new study released yesterday has demonstrated conclusively that the year 2013 is not yet over. The study, which has shown that there may be as many as sixteen days
				left in 2013 as of today, has caused panic among major news organizations which, under the impression that 2013 had ended last week, had released their various stats, lists,
				and 'Top 10's of 2013. As the author of the study said, &quot;Although many people seem to be under the impression that 2013 is over, our findings show that this is not the case.
				So there's still time for a few memorable events. President Obama could go on a public bath salts binge! North Korea could invade South Korea! Justin Bieber could do something!
				Congress could pass more than the most basic legislation! Well, not that last one. But you see my point; it turns out that everyone has really jumped the gun here. 2013 is
				not over yet.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;CNN responded to the findings by declaring the study fourth in the 'Top 10 Crazy Studies of 2013'.

		<Title>Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is Not A Real Person, Says Study</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Global</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				A study released today by the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Things That Don't Happen In Real Life&lt;/i&gt; concluded that the embattled, crack-smoking mayor of Toronto does not
				exist. The study found that Ford's saga is so absurd that it doesn't merely push believability, it breaks right through the barrier of belief to the beautiful
				paradise of conspiracy. Ford simply can't be real, the study says, because people that absurd simply don't actually exist. How absurd is Rob Ford? Here's a
				quick refresher, helpfully provided by Jon Stewart:
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://on.cc.com/13GUMrG&quot;&gt;Rob Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://on.cc.com/16C16X3&quot;&gt;More Rob Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://on.cc.com/16F6Q21&quot;&gt;This man is f**king unbelievable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://on.cc.com/1bgZIZH&quot;&gt;Oh my god.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://on.cc.com/176MbEt&quot;&gt;I can't wait to see what happens next!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Are you really still reading this? Haven't you passed out from laughing yet?&lt;br/&gt;
				Since &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Ford has now admitted to smoking crack during a drunken stupor and is suspected of seeing a prostitute, snorting crack, driving while drunk,
				sexually harassing staffers&lt;/span&gt;, [I can't even think what to say here] etc. However, according to the Stupid People Research Center, stratigically located in Miami,
				Florida, Rob Ford does not actually exist. The leader of the study, Andrew Marinelli, wrote that &quot;We here at the Stupid People Research Center have spent years studying
				amazing people such as Anthony Wiener, Herman Cain, Charlie Sheen, Donald Trump, and others. We have used this data to develop the Dumbass Scale to measure stupidity.
				The scale ranges from 0 to 100, and includes all conceivable levels of stupid. Toronto mayor Rob Ford scores 351 on the scale. Therefore, we have concluded that Ford
				and his actions are entirely fictitious.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Marinelli spends most of the paper describing the calculations involved in the Dumbass Scale and the thorough math that led the team to their conclusion. He does, however,
				take a few sentences at the end of the article to make some guesses about how Rob Ford came to not-exist. According to Marinelli, &quot;Since we have virtually no data on the 
				subject, we can only speculate on the identity of the person or organization that invented Rob Ford. It's possible that the Obama Administration invented Ford to distract 
				people from the healthcare screwup. However, we think it's more likely that he was created by the Canadian government to make sure no one, anywhere, &lt;b&gt;ever&lt;/b&gt; calls 
				Canada boring again.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When interviewed later, Marinelli was asked why, if Rob Ford was fictitious, he had a record of public appearances, a birth certificate, and election wins. Marinelli 
				responded, simply, &quot;Math doesn't lie.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;

			WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;
			GO SOX! GO SOX! GO SOX! GO SOX! &lt;b&gt;GO SOX!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Ahem.&lt;br/&gt;
			Sorry.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Fans across Massachusetts, the state we will pretend everyone did suddenly not realize I live in, were ecstatic last night after the Boston Red Sox &lt;b&gt;WON THE WORLD
			SERIES AT HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 96 YEARS!!!!!!!! GO SOX!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Again, Sorry. We have to maintain &lt;b&gt;GO SOX!&lt;/b&gt; patriotic spirit here at News from Rockettopia.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Bostonians celebrated the Sox's victory, which shone especially when contrasted with the dismal season the team experienced last year, by getting drunk and yelling.
			This is known colloquially in Boston as a 'Wednesday'. When interviewed, fans responded ecstatically to the win, and many saw it as a sign of Massachusetts' recovery
			after the twin tragedies of the Boston Marathon Bombing of last April and Mitt Romney.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Wait for it...&lt;br/&gt;

		<Text>
			This Halloween has seen a continuation in the growing trend of sexy Halloween costumes. These costumes, which are exactly what they sound like, are...&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;raise the question...&lt;br/&gt;
			show...&lt;br/&gt;
			make one think...&lt;br/&gt;
			interact with Rockettopia in some way...&lt;br/&gt;
			Dammit! How can I make fun of this!? This is so stupid!!! The world has already made this dumb trend so extreme that it's a parody of itself. Normally, I'd
			take something stupid like 'Sexy Pizza' and 'Sexy Walter White' and 'Sexy Bacon' and 'Sexy NSA Agent' and make up things like 'Sexy Leatherface' and 'Sexy
			Mental Patient' and 'Anna Rexia' and 'Sexy Osama bin Laden', but ALL THOSE ARE REAL!! I didn't HAVE to make them up! How am I supposed to make something up to
			top that kind of offensive absurdity!! Sexy Barack Obama? Nah, that would be trying too hard. Really, once there's Sexy bin Laden, it's physically impossible
			to fall any further.&lt;br/&gt;
			Please don't take that as a challenge. Please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			In all Seriousness Notes:&lt;br/&gt;
			1. If a costume has the modifier 'Sexy' in it, it's probably something that should not be sexy.&lt;br/&gt;
			2. Please don't wear any of these costumes.&lt;br/&gt;
			
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegehumor.com/pictures/gallery/6930077/seriously-these-20-costumes-should-not-be-sexy&quot;&gt;If you want to be mentally traumatized, here are

			&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cracked.com/photoplasty_464_23-horrible-ideas-sexy-halloween-costumes/&quot;&gt;If you want to be even more traumatized, here are some things that

		<Title>RHS Religious Club Holds Pre-Halloween Seminar on Demonic Possession</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In preparation for Halloween, the Rockettopia High School religious club will be holding a seminar on Demonic Possession in the auditorium after school this 
				coming Monday. The speakers, who include professional public lunatic Pat Robertson, professional politician and bigot Rick Santorum, rocker and gun-toting 
				racist wacko Ted Nugent, and the principal, will cover topics such as how to spot demonic possession, how to deal with demonic possession in others, and how 
				to avoid being possessed yourself. All of these are standard demonic possession topics.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, this seminar will also cover a topic specific to Rockettopia: How to tell the difference between Demonic Possession and drugs. the topic will be covered in 
				depth in a two-hour joint lecture by the Reverend Terry Jones and a local teenager known as Cool Jim, who will discuss the similarities and differences between 
				Demonic Possession and common drugs like LSD and Meth. Although anyone who has everyday encounters with drug users (Read: Everyone) is strongly encouraged to attend, 
				the website for the seminar has put out a few simple tips:
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;If the person is talking about demons, Satan or the devil, you should at least look closely for other signs of Demonic Possession.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;If the person attempts to conceal their symptoms, it's a strong sign of demonic possession.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;A change in eye color is a sure sign of demonic possession.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember: If a person turns out to be just on drugs, do the polite thing and pretend not to notice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The RHS Wicca Club will be holding its own seminar at the same date and time to discuss similar issues. Their seminar, which will be held in the local cemetery,
				will discuss the positive impacts of demonic possession and debunk some major urban legends about the 'dangers' of the condition.

		<Title>Congress Now Wishing it was as Popular as Iran</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Politics</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In a series of new interviews with anonymous congresspeople, ABC News found that, as of Saturday, a majority of Congress wishes it was as popular as Iran.
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;As the government shutdown crisis continues and the Debt Ceiling looms, Congress' popularity among Americans has slipped to 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/congress-approval-rating_n_4069899.html&quot;&gt;5%, less popular than hemorrhoids and toenail fungus&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time,
				Iran has shown a marked spike in popularity as it's new president Hassan Rouhani has shown himself to be less threaten-people-with-nukes-especially-Israel-y than
				his predecessor. As Iran has admitted UN inspectors to confirm that its nuclear is purely for peaceful purposes.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Likely due to a combination of these factors, Congress' approval rating is now far below that of &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Iran, which recently got a fifteen percent
				global approval rating, which in Congress is known as a &quot;High point&quot;.&lt;/span&gt; So it's not surprising that John Boehner is growing a beard and many Congresspeople
				wish they could have Iran's public approval.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, despite Congress' best efforts, their popularity seems to just keep plummeting. Another poll has shown that the phrase &quot;It's scary that these wackos have
				nuclear weapons.&quot; is applied more to Congress than to Iran and North Korea combined, and a significant number of Americans are considering moving to a place like
				Russia, where the one guy makes all the terrible decisions without having to argue with anyone.

		<Title>Shutdown Beginning to Impact Congress' Ability to Do Nothing</Title>

		<Text>
			With the shutdown of the United States Government in it's eleventh day, journalists have begun to report an impact in Congress' ability to do nothing at all.
			According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newslo.com/&quot;&gt;The Newslo&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;The last week and a half have seen a marked drop in Congressional inaction. If the shutdown
			continues, congress' ability to argue pointlessly and fail to accomplish even the most basic tasks may be altogether compromised.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
			Worse still, if the shutdown continues, we might actually start noticing.

		<Title>Rockettopia High School RADD Club: An Overview</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				This year, Rockettopia High School welcomed a new addition to the club scene: The Rockettopians Against Destructive Decisions, or RADD, Club. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;
				The RADD club teaches students about avoiding destructive decisions such as doing drugs, drinking alcohol, and having sex.&lt;/span&gt; If they can make an impact,
				the club's &quot;Advisor&quot;, Mr. Steinberg, plans to move on to eating ice cream, hanging out with friends, using the Internet, and smiling. The Club was planned and
				named by a committee of teachers who apparently are not aware that the 1970s were forty years ago. The name choice was probably made with the slang term 'Rad'
				in mind, which was last heard from on June 7th, 1999. 'Rad' is, of course, short for radical, which makes sense, because here in Rockettopia, not having sex,
				doing drugs, and drinking alcohol are pretty radical decisions.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				According to reports, the first meeting of the RADD club was attended by eight students: five students who had been dared to go, one lost freshman, the club 
				'Advisor' Mr. Steinberg's daughter, and a severely intoxicated senior who staggered into the classroom, mumbled some flirtatious comments to a poster, and
				collapsed due to alcohol poisoning.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Did you know: The Hawai'ian alphabet has twelve letters!&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			Note: &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The RADD club was apparently started in 2009&lt;/span&gt;, but until now, the entire student body has been too drunk or stoned to notice.
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			Other Note: Despite the odd aptness of the name, &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;the RADD club is officially an offshoot of the national Students Against Destructive
			Decisions, or SADD club.&lt;/span&gt; [I'm just going to leave this one you.]

		<Title>Pirate Flag Over RHS Misunderstood by Everyone</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;When students at Rockettopia High School returned from summer break, they couldn't help but notice the pirate flag flying above the
				school. Most people interpret it as a taunt from Rockettopia's arch-nemesis.&lt;/span&gt; These people are wrong. A few people claim that it was put up by 
				RHS students to start a war. These people are also wrong. In fact, the Jolly Roger over Rockettopia High School signifies what the skull-and-crossbones
				has signified since time immemorial: That this building is now under the control of pirates.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In fact, the school is now officially the property of the crew of the &lt;i&gt;Merman Crackhead&lt;/i&gt;, a sixteenth-century pirate vessel that most historians refer to as 
				a 'glorified rowboat'. The &lt;i&gt;Merman Crackhead&lt;/i&gt; was believed until very recently to have been lost after striking a very sharp piece of seaweed, but it now 
				appears that the ship somehow found it's way to Anthos Pond. If anyone has any knowledge of how this happened, please email the United States Historical Society 
				and/or the United States Armed Forces.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				After making the five-minute walk to Rockettopia High School, the pirates apparently seized control of the building, originally intending to pillage it, but after 
				finding 'riches beyond imagining' (RHS Cafeteria Food is much better than Hardtack), decided to stay.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Despite the presence of eighty pirates and two monkeys in RHS, very few people have caught on. First of all, to an untrained eye, the difference between smelly 
				poorly-dressed sexually obsessed delinquent alcoholics and pirates can be difficult to discern. Secondly, when we tried to tell authorities of the pirate threat, 
				we were rebuffed with the reminder that nearly the entire student body is guilty of piracy. And most importantly, anyone who might notice the pirates are either 
				sleep-deprived, drunk, stoned, teachers, or most likely, all of the above.
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>Violent War Erupts in Cafeteria Over Seats</Title>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The 2013-2014 school year in Rockettopia got off to a bad start yesterday when violence erupted in all three lunches over the seating arrangements in the 
				cafeteria. More specifically, lack of said seats. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;As Rockettopia High School's population has grown over the last few years, the cafeteria,
				which was designed to seat three hundred students, has been unable to seat sufficient numbers. The school administration has already tried bringing in new tables,
				bringing in even more new tables,&lt;/span&gt; and as of this year is offering toilet accommodations as &quot;Dual-purpose seating&quot;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
				Despite this, there weren't enough seats to go around, resulting in a massive food fight in which, unlike the food fights that occur every day, the victor 
				actually mattered. &quot;My brothers! This table is our last hope! Now fight, not for your wives or children or villages, but for NOT SITTING ON THE FLOOR!!!&quot;, 
				a member of the Anime club was heard to shout before the club charged the baseball team. During the attack, he was hit in the head by a &quot;Hamburger&quot;, but the 
				doctors say his condition has stabilized and they have high hopes for his recovery.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The baseball club wasn't the only club to engage in outright warfare. The band club broke all the rules and two clarinets when they deployed their 
				instruments as weapons. Two people were severely poked, five deafened, and a police team is currently searching for three missing students inside one of 
				the tubas. The ecology club and the robotics team were beaten severely by the football team, and stormed out vowing revenge. (In related news, the 
				football team has acquired an indefinite full-team vacation to the pacific island of Fiji.). After going outside for ten, minutes to &quot;meditate&quot;, the 
				Existential club stormed the cafeteria demanding more food, but of course, that's what they do pretty much every day.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Some students got extremely desperate and took measures considered wild even by Rockettopia standards; president Obama has warned that the United States 
				will take action if the Chemistry club ever does that again.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			The only people to entirely escape the war in the cafeteria were the skateboarders, who everyone refused to go anywhere near.

		<Title>Discovery Channel Employee Leaks Shark Week Conclusion</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			An anonymous leak from a Discovery Channel employee revealed that the network's popular Shark Week series would conclude with &quot;An epic look at shark-based 
			weather phenomena and their effects on human life in urban environments.&quot; When pressed for more details, the leaker confirmed everyone's worst fears and revealed 
			that he was referring to &lt;i&gt;Sharknado&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/iwsqFR5bh6Q&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Shark Week, by contrast, has a slightly more sane reputation. The annual Discovery event began in 1987 to &quot;raise awareness and respect for 
			sharks&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The event was also, like everything on Discovery, supposed to be at least vaguely educational. However, over the years, the content of 
			Shark Week has gone from, &quot;Look at the interesting shark!&quot; to &quot;OH MY GOD GIANT SCARY SHARK!!!&quot; But the Week, and perhaps the network, reached new lows when 
			Shark Week 2013 with a documentary about a team that discovers that Megalodon sharks are still alive (Megalogon being an enormous prehistoric shark that you 
			should totally google). The documentary was convincing, entrancing, and according to the tiny text at the bottom of the screen at the end, completely fake. 
			But really, John Oliver expresses the offensive bullshittiness of the situation better than I do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/gnlh0e/sharks--lies--and-videotape&quot;&gt;John Oliver on Sharks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			According to the Discovery leak, the finale of Shark Week will be even more spectacular. &lt;i&gt;Sharknado&lt;/i&gt; will be prefaced with a black screen bearing the message in
			large white text and voiced-over, &quot;What you are about to witness is a dramatization of an event that top meteorologists say has a 90% chance of occuring in 
			your lifetime.&quot;. (Our investigative reporters that &quot;top meteorologists&quot; meant an unemployed twentysomething who had watched &lt;i&gt;Sharknado&lt;/i&gt; while drinking six beers. 
			He was being paraphrased; his original words were, &quot;Dude, this is totally gonna happen to me!&quot;) At the same time, this text will be at the bottom of the screen 
			&quot;This is not actually real. The events of &lt;i&gt;Sharknado&lt;/i&gt; are in no way actually possible. Ha ha! Fooled ya!&quot;. Of course, the black text might not show up on the black 
			screen, but, &quot;That's the point.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			1. Okay, I quoted Wikipedia, so sue me.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Note: Is &lt;i&gt;Sharknado&lt;/i&gt; possible? In short, no. &lt;br/&gt;

		<Title>A Month After End Of School, Students Already Bored Out Of Their Minds</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				A new piece of original journalism by field reporters from News from Rockettopia has confirmed that, despite being only a month into the summer, 
				Rockettopia students are already bored to death. By bravely venturing into the center of town, where bored youth are congregating to try to 
				find something interesting, our reporters discovered that at this point, nearly everyone between the ages of five and eighteen has no idea what 
				to do with their time now that school is out. &quot;I thought it would be so fun hanging out with friends and swimming and watching TV and doing other 
				cool stuff,&quot; a Rockettopia teen told us, &quot;but it turns out that all that stuff only gets through about four days of summer.&quot; Some teens have 
				even reported missing the time spent doing homework, which our resident psychologist has told us is called Stockholm Syndrome.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				We here at News from Rockettopia hope that our town's teenager will find something interesting to do soon both for their sake and for the sake 
				of all the store clerks hiding under counters with shotguns.

		<Title>Ambassador Lands on Pitcairn Islands</Title>

		<Text>
			Crowds cheered in the streets of Rockettopia when news arrived that an airplane had observed the new American ambassador to the Pitcairn Islands had 
			successfully paradropped into his destination. Unfortunately, the details of the ambassador's first encounter with the Pitcairn Islanders has not 
			arrived yet, as the only way to communicate with Pitcairn is through carrier albatross. Although the islands did have a few telephones and an
			internet connection, most of these were traded to Tahiti and the rest were stolen. There is no cell phone reception on Pitcairn, as anyone on the 
			island can be reached by shouting.

		<Title>Performance of Inherit The Wind Interrupted by Ape Offended By The Idea That They Are Descended From Creationists</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Surprising everyone last night, the Rockettopia Middle School performance of &lt;i&gt;Inherit the Wind&lt;/i&gt; was picketed by Chimpanzees who were apparently 
				offended by the show's implication that they were descended from Creationists. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inherit the Wind&lt;/i&gt; is based on the famous 
				1925 Scopes Monkey Trial and endorses the Theory of Evolution.&lt;/span&gt; Although some people had foreseen a Creationist protest at the play, no one 
				foresaw the crowd of enraged apes who showed up to demonstrate their outrage at the offensive ideas embodied in the play. As one protestor told 
				News from Rockettopia directly before throwing his feces at us, &quot;Ook Aak Ogga [Shriek] [Shriek] [Bam] [Bam]!&quot; Our resident primatologist explained 
				that the apes were upset at the play's insistence that they were descended from a creature as tribal, violent, and blatenly irrational as the 
				creationist. Although she tried to explain that evolution merely stated that apes share a common ancestor with creationist, the apes were not 
				mollified and proceed to cover her with feces.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although most were surprised that apes rather than creationists showed up in protest, one member of the stage crew said that he wasn't too shaken. 
				&quot;When you think about it, the difference between shit-throwing apes and creationists is pretty minimal. I mean, one is a irrational, unthinking, 
				hairy, violent primate with a limited grasp of language, and the other has the scientific name &lt;i&gt;Pan troglodytes&lt;/i&gt;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;images/apes.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

		<Title>Poll Shows That Among RHS Students, 0% Care About Student Government</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				A new poll published by the Rockettopia High School Polling Club Thursday concluded that Rockettopia High School students don't care about their 
				Student Government. Among students polled who were not running for office, 100% 'Strongly Agreed' with the statement &quot;There's no difference in 
				what the different candidates will do if elected.&quot;. 83% 'Strongly Agreed' with the statement &quot;A baboon could do it.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In fact, the only people the Polling Club could find who cared at all about the student election were people running in it. Even the friends of 
				the candidates admitted that the election was not relevant to them. &quot;I mean, my friend cares about the election, since he's running,&quot; a student 
				who we, to protect his identity, will call X Wakazowkinski told us. &quot;But even though she cares about the election, I can't think of anything she'd 
				do differently then the other candidate.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			We here at News from Rockettopia agree completely. Up next: How the federal government might be spying on your phone calls and might be about to cancel school lunches!

			&lt;/p&gt;
				With the news this week that the National Security Agency, or NSA, has all of our personal information and communications in a giant database, the question 
				was raised, &quot;What the fuck are they doing with all that?&quot; The answer: Providing dating advice. In an attempt to improve the public impression of government spying, 
				NSA officials are now encouraged to give dating advice to the people whose emails and phone calls they listen in on, said an anonymous source. &quot;Sometimes when an 
				employee sees someone who's really screwing up their relationship, it can be hard for a government employee not to offer suggestions.&quot;, the leaker from his 
				hiding place, supposedly somewhere in Bhutan. &quot;Now they don't have to hold back.&quot; &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel&lt;/span&gt; did not attempt to 
				deny the NSA's new vocation. &quot;I personally am glad that all these stolen personal records are finally being put to good use.&quot;, Hagel said.

				A recent poll by the Rockettopia High Polling Club showed that although many people disapprove of the band Two Steps from Hell, none of said people have 
				ever heard a 2SFH song. The poll found that although approval ratings for 2SFH were high among youth and declined among older people, without exception the 
				people who did not like 2SFH admitted that they &quot;[had] no idea what a Two Steps from Hell song sounded like&quot;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The results of this poll surprised absolutely no one.

		<Title>Rockettopian Appointed American Ambassador to Pitcairn Islands</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;To understand the full scope of this story, one must first understand the strange British terratory officially named &quot;Pitcairn, Henderson, 
			Ducie and Oeno Islands&quot;. Although five islands make up the Pitcairn islands, only Pitcairn is inhabited. It is also 3.5km across, smaller than Disney World. 
			The current population estimate is around 48 people. Estimate because the island is virtually inaccessible, with no harbor or airstrip. The only way to get 
			ashore is by longboat. Despite it's tiny population and one internet connection, the Pitcairn islands have their own top-level domain, .pn. The .pn domain 
			became internationally known when the makers of The Hunger Games used it as the top-level domain for the fictional nation of Panem. Lionsgate studios, 
			the producer of The Hunger Games, registered one to two domains for every inhabitant of the Pitcairns.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.myhungergames.com/the-story-behind-pn]
			&lt;/sup&gt;
			The Pitcairn Islanders are almost all descended from the famous HMS Bounty mutineers and their tahitian companions, who landed on 
			Pitcairn in 1790 and have been there ever since. In 2004, the Pitcairn islands were briefly in the news when six men, including the mayor, were convicted of 
			sexually abusing children. These men represented a third of the adult male population. Despite it's tiny population, the islands have their own national language, 
			Pitkern, which has been described as 'Atlantic Creole'and 'Jar Jar Binksish'. According to Wikipedia, these are some common phrases in Pitcairn:&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
					&lt;tr&gt;
						&lt;th&gt;Pitkern&lt;/th&gt;
						&lt;th&gt;English&lt;/th&gt;

						&lt;td&gt;I nor believe.&lt;/td&gt;

					&lt;/tr&gt;
					&lt;tr&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;Humuch shep corl ya?&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;How often do ships come here?&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;/tr&gt;
					&lt;tr&gt;

						&lt;td&gt;Leave it alone!&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;/tr&gt;
					&lt;tr&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;Cooshoo!&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;Good!&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;/tr&gt;
				&lt;/table&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			Pitcairn is the British territory that assures that the sun still never sets on the British Empire &lt;sup&gt;[http://what-if.xkcd.com/48/]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			Since &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;the Pitcairn Islands have only 48 residents and can only be accessed by longboat&lt;/span&gt;, many people were surprised when President 
			Obama named notable Rockettopian Dave Westfield (RHS Class of 2002) American ambassador the Pitcairns. Westfield denies rumors that he got the job by calling 
			Obama at 1 A.M. claiming to be a House Republican. Due to the significance of the first ever ambassador to the Pitcairns being from Rockettopia, we have desired 
			to send reporter Sue Silverstien to accompany the Ambassador.&lt;br/&gt;
			The Ambassador will be leaving for the Pitcairns in two weeks with an entourage of ten people. They will be delivered to the islands via airdrop, and the entire 
			group will increase the population of the islands by 20%.&lt;br/&gt;
			We here at News from Rockettopia look forward to covering this story.

		<Title>A Modest Proposal: Improving RHS One Step At A Time Step 1 of 100257279129404975...</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
			We here at News from Rockettopia wish to indicate a potential resolution to one of the great problems plaguing our local institution of secondary education: 
			The fecal excretions of Boreal-North-American avians of the genus &lt;i&gt;Branta (Someone get the science correspondent away from the keyboard!!!)&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The thing, dudes and dudettes, is goose shit. Because dude, you know how, like, geese, like always shit all over the, like, fields and ruin all the, like, bugs, 
				ya know, dude? &lt;i&gt;(Someone drag the drug correspondent away from the computer! And while you're at it, confiscate his weed!)&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				We apologize for the inconvenience. The problem is, we have never had to cover goose crap before, so we really don't have a goose-crap-procedure. As editor, I 
				hereby take control of this story. Now, from the beginning. One day, as I was knee deep in goose shit, as I know you all have been at one time, I thought to 
				myself &quot;There must be a better way to run a football.&quot; While thinking about this, I lost the game. I also figured out a decent solution that I think will really 
				take off. What does one do with pesky birds? One shoots them &lt;b&gt;BLAM BLAM BLAM!!!!! DIE DIE DIE!!!!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;(Quick, inject him with some more sedatives!)&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				So... Kill the geese. But how? And then it came to A RHS Shooting Class! Since a baboon with a wallet could go into a store and buy a dozen assault rifles 
				with cash these days, it seems like it would be good for our youth to know what guns will kill you, and what guns will kill you and a bunch of your friends 
				without reloading. So, a gun class including target practice on geese. The school board will object, but the NRA will probably donate money to buy them over to 
				the plan. They'll be all over this. So, dead geese.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Stage 2: Cook the geese. The Rockettopia High School cooking class cooks the dead geese. Straightforward enough.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Step 3: Serve the meals prepared from the geese in the Rockettopia High School cafeteria, thereby saving money on feeding the students. I'm sure the students 
				will be very happy as well. Given two choices, a poorly-prepared and likely contaminated meal made from an animal not normally eaten by humans, and cooked 
				Canada Goose, I feel confident that nearly all of my fellow students will choose the latter.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			So everyone! Request that the school initiate the Goose-to-food plan now!&lt;br/&gt;
			Or just go and shoot geese. Doesn't matter to me.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			(Don't let him see that I told you this, but his writing is terrible because most of our articles are outsourced to sweat-shops in India. This is the first time
			he had to write something.)

			&lt;p&gt;
				A continuing poll by the Rockettopia High School Polling Club is suggesting that no one likes the Westboro Baptist Church. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Westboro 
				Baptist Church, which stages extremely homophobic protests at the funerals of dead soldiers, has been called &quot;The most reviled group in America.&quot; by me, just 
				now.&lt;/span&gt; The RHSPC set out to find out how many Americans agree with the church's views. The question was, &quot;What is your opinion of the Westboro Baptist 
				Church?&quot;, and the answer choices were &quot;I don't know what that is.&quot;, &quot;I'm a fan&quot;, &quot;I dislike gays but think they're very offensive.&quot;, &quot;I have no opinion.&quot;, 
				&quot;I dislike them.&quot;, &quot;I hate them.&quot;, &quot;I really hate them.&quot;, and &quot;If hell exists, it has a special place for people like that.&quot;. After early issues, the RHSPC 
				found it necessary to add a new response, &quot;None of those options, not even the last one, can express my loathing for those scum.&quot;. In a poll of RHSers, the 
				RHSPC found that most had heard of the Westboro Baptist Church, and in that group, opinions ranged from &quot;I hate them.&quot; to the last one. Not a single student 
				was found to like the Church.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				To continue the search for a Westboro Baptist Church fan, the RHSBC scaled up their polls of students and still found no one who supported the Church. They 
				expanded the poll to Rockettopia townsfolk and still found no one. Even after every human being in Rockettopia had been polled, not a single person had 
				chosen &quot;I'm a fan.&quot; or &quot;I have no opinion.&quot;. With assistance from major journalistic organizations, the poll was expanded to the entire country, and when 
				no supporters of the Church were found in all of America, the world. At the time of this writing, over five billion people have been polled, and not a single 
				one has supported the Westboro Baptist Church. Mullah Muhammed Omar, leader of the Taliban, picked &quot;Dislike gays but they're offensive.&quot; When asked about 
				his choice, Omar commented, &quot;The Taliban shoots teenage girls in the head, but those Westboro Baptist Church people, they're a little extreme for us.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Pollsters are currently attempting to contact isolated tribes in the Amazon Rainforest to get their opinion. Another group is using radio waves to try to 
				find out what any observing aliens think. At this point, the RHSPC has concluded that, in all likelihood, not a single human being supports the Westboro 
				Baptist Church.

				After &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Pepsico released a commercial for Mountain Dew in which a goat is seen against a lineup of black men accused of assaulting an 
				elderly white woman, the Internet exploded into outrage, prompting Pepsico to withdraw the commercial and apologize, as it very well should.&lt;/span&gt; However, 
				one group is not satisfied with Pepsico's response: Goats. Nibbles, the head of the NAAGP (National Association for the Advancement of Goat Peoples) was 
				that Pepsico thought it acceptable to portray goats as criminals, tweeting &quot;Bleat maaa mehhhh baaa bleat bleeeaaat.&quot; Translated by the mysterious mountain 
				man known as the 'Goat Whisperer', the tweet reads, &quot;We here at the NAAGP are very disappointed in Pepsico! Shame on you!&quot; Pepsico responded that they 
				had intended no offence to goats through the ad. Nonetheless, Nibbles demanded a boycott of Mountain Dew before leaving to rush to her afternoon milking.

		<Title>Poll Finds 50% of Rockettopia High School Teachers Cannot Tell the Difference between Twitter and Angry Birds</Title>

			The entire student body was horrified today when a new poll showed that among Rockettopia High School teachers, nearly half believed that Twitter and 
			Angry Birds were the same thing. &quot;I always just thought it was 'Angry Twitter-Birds' that all the kids were playing in the hallway. But now they say 
			that Twitter is a 'Social Network'? Those kids and their gosh-darn gadgets!&quot; commented one teacher, whose name we are politely not revealing. For those 
			of you who live in caves without wifi, Twitter is a social networking website that limits posts to 140 characters, while Angry Birds is a front for Al-Qaeda. 
			Some students have been attempting to help the teachers understand the difference by writing essays in 140 characters and throwing bird-shaped objects through 
			windows. Still, the problem persists.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Speaking of Twitter, we here at News from Rockettopia now have a Twitter account! As you probably noticed because it's on every page! Now 
			be a dear and press that 'Follow' button.&lt;/span&gt;

		<Title>Movie Director Severely Wounded after Turkey Attack</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				In a terrible attack yesterday, popular movie director Colin Trevorrow was hospitalized with serious injuries following a deadly turkey attack. According to 
				reports released by Trevorrow's agent, &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;the director of Safety Not Guaranteed&lt;/span&gt; showed that this was certainly true in his case when 
				six large male turkeys somehow entered his hotel and confronted him in the kitchen. Despite the director's attempts to hide behind counters and cooking 
				implements, he was eventually found by the birds, which then attacked him seemingly with the goal of ending his promising career. Fortunately, a hotel staff 
				member found Trevorrow under attack and called 911, then proceed to heroically beat the birds back with a broom, probably saving the director's life. EMTs 
				quickly rushed Trevorrow to the hospital, where he is in critical condition but expected to survive.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Some have blamed the tragic attack on the Rockettopia High School Palaeontology Club. A controversy has been brewing over the last week after &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;
				Trevorrow, who has been picked to direct Jurassic Park IV, explicitly tweeted that his dinosaurs will have &quot;No Feathers&quot;. This has sparked outrage among everyone 
				who knows anything about dinosaurs&lt;/span&gt;, the most prominent local group being the RHS Paleontology Club. According to some suspicions, the Paleontology Club 
				released the turkeys into Trevorrow's hotel in the hopes of injuring him or at least changing his mind. To counter these accusations, the Paleontology Club 
				released the following statement: &quot;We here at the RHSPC are saddened about the tragic attack on Colin Trevorrow, who we greatly admire. We are thankful that the 
				animals attacking him lacked claws, talons, and massive teeth evolved for ripping through flesh. If this was not the case, the director might not be here today. 
				We are sure he will never think a turkey looks silly again.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			The club has also been encouraging people to tweet Trevorrow (&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;@colintrevorrow&lt;/span&gt;) about the feathers issue with the hashtag #YesFeathers. 
			WE CAN DO IT!!!

		<Title>Earth Day Issue: Earth Complains about Week-late Birthday Parties, Green Team Hosts Cleanup, and SSE Hosts Coal-burning Protest</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>Miscellaneous</Topic>
		<Text>
			The planet Earth herself spoke out today to complain about the &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;distressing number of Earth Day events scheduled a week after the actual 
			celebration&lt;/span&gt;. &quot;It's kinda annoying&quot;, the planet told reporters. &quot;I just want to yell 'It was last week idiots!'&quot; Earth has not spoken on the issue since.
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Rockettopia Cleanup Committee has a massive cleanup planned for this weekend, a week after earth day (*sigh*). The RHS Green Team, which 
			is helping at the event, hopes to see a lot of RHS students at the event. &quot;We hope we can make a dent in this town's significant litter problem. We have a problem 
			in this town with plastic bags, other bags, plastic cups, tin cans, plastic bottles, rusted car parts, rusted cars,&lt;/span&gt; and a stranded World War II-era battleship. 
			Not sure how that got there.&quot; When we asked the president why RHS students should attend the cleanup, she replied that there would be food, but refused to give details.
			A team member who wished to remain anonymous told News from Rockettopia that the contents of the snacks had been kept confidential in fear of a stampede of volunteers. 
			&quot;We're hoping for a few dozen people, and a few hundred would be wonderful. But if we told everyone about the refreshments, we might be dealing with crowds of a hundred
			thousand and above.&quot; The team had apparently decided to keep the information classified after a computer model showed that volunteers might come from as far away as 
			Montana, and the combined weight of all the humans might cause Rockettopia to sink into the ground. Still, the team says, all volunteers are welcome. [For more 
			information, see INS Note.]
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			Not everyone likes Earth Day. For example, the RHS Supply Side Economics club plans to hold a Coal-burning protest to raise awareness about how environmental 
			regulations hurt billionaires. &quot;We're very worried that when the government tries to stop companies from, say, turning a river into a lifeless sludge flow, 
			the government is hurting one of the most vulnerable groups in the country: Multi-billion-dollar corporations and their billionaire owners.&quot;, the president 
			of the SSE club told us when we reached him on his private yacht. &quot;If pointless regulations on the amount of carcinogens a coal plant releases into the air 
			are kept in place, CEOs may have to lay off some workers to preserve their million-dollar bonuses. That would be a true tragedy, and that's why we're staging 
			a coal-burning rally to protest this horrible attempt to preserve what's left of life on earth.&quot; As a final note, the president of the SSE club denied rumors 
			that he practices kissing on a poster of Ayn Rand in his room. We here at News from Rockettopia could find no evidence of such rumors. In preparation for the 
			coal-burning rally, hospitals in the Rockettopia area are prepping their internal burn wards for a flood of patients.
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;INS (In All Seriousness) Note: For those of you who live in...you know where, the actual cleanup is at 500 Dedham Avenue, Saturday April 27th, 
			from 8:00 AM to ~11:00AM. Everyone is welcome, and you should come no matter how long you stay. I will actually be there, if that helps.&lt;/span&gt; Note: Deflate head.

		<Title>Police Sting Fails when Drug Sniffing Dogs Confused with Drug Snorting Dogs</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Recently, students from Rockettopia High School requested that the police bring drug sniffing dogs to root out RHS's drug problem. Drug sniffing dogs are, 
				of course, dogs that have been specially trained to locate illegal drugs such as Marijuana. Drug snorting dogs are, of course, exactly what they sound like.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Our reporters have determined that Rockettopia's drug snorting dogs were the result of a collaboration between the Existential Club and the Ecology Club. 
				The Ecology club wanted to test their theories on the effects of benzoylmethylecgonine on the nervous systems, specifically the frontal cortex of the brain. 
				The Existential club was bored and had too much money on their hands. The results, a few years later, were trained dogs that would quickly locate drugs, and 
				then stop at nothing to consume them.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				This all would have been harmless to everyone but the dogs and the ASPCA if the Rockettopia Police Department had not somehow gotten their drug sniffing dogs 
				replaced with the drug snorting dogs. (The Spy Club denied any responsibility in the incident two hours before it actually happened) Unfortunately for the poor 
				police officers, the dogs swiftly devoured all forms of restricted substance on school premises. The drug-craving canines tore open metal lockers with their 
				bare paws and shredded walls to get their drug fix. By the time the national guard managed to restore control six hours later, all evidence of drug use among 
				students was gone and the school had suffered over a hundred thousand dollars worth of damage. Fortunately, the school is expected to be fully repaired by the 
				end of spring break. The drug snorting dogs have been sent to an addiction vet.

		<Title>Paranoia Club Insists Angry Birds is a Terrorist Front</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Rockettopia High School Investigative Club, also known as the Paranoia Club, today announced their new campaign to convince the school that Angry Birds 
				is a front for Al-Qaeda. On past occasions  the Paranoia Club has attempted to alert the school that the moon landings were fake, that the CIA assassinated JFK, 
				that the government brought down the world trade center, and most recently, that the government brought down the Sears Tower. Whenever someone points out that the 
				Sears Tower (Now called Willis Tower) is still standing, the Paranoia Club responds, &quot;That's what THEY want you to think!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
				The Paranoia club points out that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Angry Birds is about flying things into towers to destroy them and kill things, which is basically what 
				Al-Qaeda does.&lt;/span&gt; And now that you think about it, that does make sense... And if you add up the scrabble values for the letters in &quot;Angry Birds&quot;, you get 
				the same number as the scrabble value for &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot;! And that number is 99, which is 9 times 11! And if you take the first word in the Koran that starts with 
				each letter in &quot;Angry Birds&quot; and mash them together...
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				NO! I'M NOT CRAZY! &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1013/&quot;&gt;WAKE UP SHEEPLE!&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				[Okay, we got him off.] With the Paranoia Club's new press, we decided to interview the president of the Paranoia Club about his club's actions. &quot;We don't 
				necessarily agree on everything. We have conservative conspiracy nuts, liberal conspiracy nuts, creationists, Scientologists, birthers, 9/11 Truthers, Autism 
				Vaccine People, and all sorts of others.&quot;, she told us. &quot;We try not to argue about our differing views on what organization is controlling the world and what 
				they're doing. We all work together to stop the abstract 'Other' that is definitely out to get us.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
				Since their announcement about Angry Birds, the Paranoia club has seen a huge spike in membership. All of the fifteen new recruits will now have to be tested to 
				make sure they're not robots.

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;A group of Rockettopia High School Students approached the Rockettopia School Committee this Tuesday to request drug dogs at RHS. The students 
				were dispatched by the RHS student council, which has grown increasingly concerned about the drug problem at RHS.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;This problem was exemplified in a sting operation on March 14th that led to the arrest of two students selling Marijuana, Zoloft, and Tramadol. 
				The student council imminently expressed their disappointment that students were dealing illegal and prescription drugs&lt;/span&gt;, and the Existential Club expressed 
				their relief that the police had not found the Cocaine, Meth, LSD, Bath Salts, Toads, Mushrooms, and Millipedes.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The student council decided to act on the drug problem&lt;/span&gt; dispute half of the members not knowing what Marijuana is. When asked, one council 
				member replied, &quot;I'm not entirely sure. I think it's something like chewing gum. But it's really bad, I know that. If you get caught with it, the teacher asks you 
				to stay after, which is the worst they can do, right?&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				After the local newspaper printed the names of the students who approached the school committee, the Existential Club told News from Rockettopia that they plan to 
				give the offending students &quot;An in-depth lesson on the fish life of Rockettopia. We expect them to be fully immersed and breathless with excitement.&quot;

		<Title>Wellness Class Test Determines Which Form of Delusional Ignorance You Have</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;On Tuesday of this week, the sophomores here at Rockettopia High School took the traditional Wellness* test to determine which of the two 
			types of delusional ignorance they had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			The unit was about something called the Locust of Control. This is whether one believes that all events are governed by free will, or all events are chance 
			and we have no free will. There are, of course, only two opinions on the issue, both of which are delusional ignorance. There is no way to believe that some 
			events, such as whether you win the lottery or whether you get hit by a car, are random chance and others, such as a test grade, are controlled. The idea that 
			what country you live in helps determine your ability to climb the social ladder is quite frankly laughable, as is the concept that perhaps teaching students 
			an oversimplified system of absolutes is a bad idea. The curriculum has been determined to be wildly successful by the teacher who teaches it and people who 
			have no connection, and is expected to be included again next year.&lt;br/&gt;
			On a related note, a group of very confused RHS students have formed the Church of the Controlling Grasshopper. Meetings are Wednesdays after school in the 
			cafeteria for all interested in attending.

		<Title>Pope Francis Endorsed by Jesus</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>Global</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Just hours ago, the new Pope Francis received a surprise endorsement from Jesus Christ. From his throne alongside the almighty in heaven, Jesus 
				released a statement, &quot;I am aware that I don't often do this, but I would like to state my approval of Pope Francis. I feel that he is sort of 
				doing holy work.&quot; Even critics of the pope were impressed and excited about these words of praise.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Jesus had not endorsed a pope since the official creation of the office in 366 A.D.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&quot;Although John Paul II came close, he didn't really cut it in terms of charity.&quot;, Jesus also mentioned during his endorsement. Although Jesus 
				did not go beyond broad generalizations in his explanation of why he endorsed Francis, many prominent theologians have offered explanations. 
				Many cardinals have pointed out that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Francis has refused to wear the ornamental red shoes of the papacy [Insert 
				'Wizard of Oz' joke of your choosing here], decided to live in the Vatican guest house instead of the papal suite, used public transportation 
				as a bishop in Argentina, and above all, extreme concern for the welfare of the poor.&lt;/span&gt; Non-church officials have speculated that the 
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;rumors that as a cardinal, Francis supported gay civil unions behind closed doors in Argentina&lt;/span&gt; might have to do 
				with it. Whatever the reason, the church is very excited now.

		<Title>In Concolatory Match, Knowing Stuff Team is Soundly Defeated by Trained Snails</Title>

			After their &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;disastrous defeat yesterday on the public television show &quot;High School Quiz Show&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, the RHS Knowing 
			Stuff Team was not feeling very good (NOTE: We really, really don't want you to look this up). To make themselves feel better, the team arranged 
			a match against the Ecology Club's trained land snails. However, in a surprise victory, the snails trounced the Knowing Stuff Team by a massive 
			margin of 315-110. The success of the snails has been accredited to their knowledge of important categories such as 'Plants that are Good Snail Food', 
			'Slime Making 101', 'Snail Anatomy', and 'Animal Mobile Homes'. When asked the snails about their victory, we got this response:

		<Title>New Marijuana Dowsing Rod Fails</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Unfortunately, Rockettopia High School's trials of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/8T_jwq9ph8k?t=58s&quot;&gt;$900 Marijuana Dowsing Rod&lt;/a&gt; failed when 
				instead of pointing to lockers full of Marijuana, the consistently pointed towards skateboarders. As the teacher in charge of supervising 
				the tests said, &quot;The rod completely failed because we would be walking down the hallway, and a skateboarder walks by, and the rod refuses 
				to point away from him. It was absurd.&quot;. The most impressive case of this was when the rod successfully located the guy responsible for the 
				locker fire back in January from half way across the school.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&quot;We did try to use the rod for something useful&quot;, the aforementioned teacher commented, &quot;but when we tried strip-searching a skateboarder, it ended badly. 
				Three teachers are still in the hospital suffering from mental trauma. Get well soon!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The tests ended on Friday, both because the dowsing rod was completely ineffective and because it exploded when brought near a member of the Existential Club.

			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;As a massive snowstorm bore down on our state, the government decided to postpone the MCAS tests.&lt;/span&gt; These tests, which have been 
			praised by Satan himself and are also given to detainees at Guantanamo Bay, albeit for different reasons, were cancelled due to imminent danger of the 
			entire state being snowed in. However, some unfortunate students apparently did not get the message in time. We know this because thousands of students, 
			almost five percent in Rockettopia, entirely failed to show up today. However, we were able to reach one of them via Facebook chat. For his safety, we 
			concealed his name.

			Reporter: Hello *****************. We noticed you weren't at school today.&lt;br/&gt;
			Student: wtf is it 2 u ?u tnk us the boss of me&lt;br/&gt;

		<Title>Les Miserables Prostitutes "Overdressed" Say RHS Theatergoers</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Rockettopia High School production of Les Miserables this weekend was a tremendous hit. All three performances were sold out. 
				All the acting was incredible and everyone loved it&lt;/span&gt; except the Complaining Club. However, one objection did emerge in many students who attended: 
				the prostitutes were wearing too much.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;I'm not going to go into too much description, but it suffices to say that compared to what's considered acceptable at RHS, the prostitutes'
				garb was somewhere around the level of 'Arab Housewife'. To see more skin showing, all one would have to do is walk into any classroom in RHS.&lt;/span&gt;
				The next most common complaint was that the three-hour musical was 'Way too short'.

		<Title>Poll finds that 60% of RHS Students Believe that "Take Back the Night" club is About Controlling Raccoons</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				A poll released earlier today by the Rockettopia Depressing Polling Organization showed that among f students asked the question &quot;What does the 
				'Take Back the Night Club' do?&quot;, 60% gave an answer involving the control of Raccoons, Coyotes, Opossums, and other nocturnal mammals. The other 
				40% were divided among the beliefs that it was a crazy project to make the sun shine at night, a counter to daylight savings time, and an advocate 
				for less homework. Only five percent got the correct answer.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The Take Back the Night club is actually about preventing dating violence&lt;/span&gt;, conversations about which usually end up at 
				the 'Does that really happen around here?' point. They sometimes do bake sales and other events to raise money and awareness about dating violence. 
				In hindsight, they probably should've seen the branding problem when of most people who came to their events ended up talking about their trash 
				cans being raided.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				We here at News from Rockettopia hope that after this article, the number of calls about wild animals every night to the Take Back the Night hotline 
				will drop below ten. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;And we also hope that everyone who reads this goes to their events.&lt;/span&gt;

		<Title>"Art in Bloom" turns bad when Ecology Club Involved</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Local</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;This year's 'Art in Bloom' flower and art show at the Rockettopia Town Library&lt;/span&gt; was a bit under par this year, as it 
				resulted in three severed hands, two missing children, and one guy losing a body part he refuses to talk about.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The problem began when the Rockettopia Flower Club, which normally arranges the flowers accompanying the art were somehow persuaded to allow the RHS 
				Ecology Club to help. The Ecology club added many exotic plants to the arrangement, but this resulted in some unintended consequences. A library 
				janitor was reported missing.  One display was found shredded by unknown forces, with nothing but a plant display nearby. When the exhibition opened, 
				the reason for the strange events was explained: Some of the ecology club plants were '&lt;s&gt;overly friendly&lt;/s&gt;' '&lt;s&gt;flesh-eating monsters&lt;/s&gt;' 
				carnivorous. The plants included six Venus flytraps, eight pitcher plants*, twenty-three sundews, and one plant that no-one would get close 
				enough to identify.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although the Ecology Club had been accused of &quot;feeding toddlers to Venus Flytraps&quot; in connection with the incident, they insist that &quot;The plants 
				are only dangerous if you get within three feet of them, so really, if you get hurt, it's your own fault.&quot; Most are not satisfied with this explanation, 
				and the Vegetarian Club has said it plans to get revenge by feeding Venus Flytraps to toddlers.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			The Rockettopia Garden Club insists that coming to view Art in Bloom tomorrow will be 'perfectly safe'.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xkhmEquJ2eQ/TOVw_Vrbc2I/AAAAAAAAAAc/9L2-43xLVag/s400/Philip_Trieu_monster.jpg&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;i&gt;You know you wouldn't get close either&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			*By pitcher plant, we do not mean a plant shaped like a water pitcher, we mean a plant that pitches globs of acidic sap at helpless passers-by.

			&lt;p&gt;
				Clearly, the Science Club has not learned their lesson about altering space-time for an ill-advised prank. This time, the particle accelerator 
				was used to introduce members of the orchestra, self-proclaimed 'Orch Dorks', to enormus green axe-wielding glasses-wearing monsters from Azaroth, 
				known to themselves as 'Arrggghhhh!!!!!' and to others as 'Orc Dorks. The results were predictable, with six musicians hospitalized, five violins 
				destroyed, and eight large, green, new recruits for the New England Patriots.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Science Club has been banned from the Particle Accelerator for two months by order of the vice principal, who has not been seen since and is 
				suspected to be in a Black Hole somewhere.

		<Title>'Downton Abbey: Season 4' to feature alarmingly high body count</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Viewers across the country were shocked and horrified at the violent conclusion to the third season of the hit TV show 'Downton 
				Abbey'.&lt;/span&gt; We here at News from Rockettopia won't give away the ending, but for those of you who haven't seen it yet, it's probably better you 
				remain ignorant. Ten minutes after the conclusion of the season finale, a Public Policy Polling Center poll showed that of Downton Abbey viewers, 
				60% were 'Shocked and outraged' by the ending, 20% were halfway to the phone when it stopped ringing, 1% thought the ending was 'right', 4% were in the 
				middle of saying likewise when the call ended with screams and cries of 'How dare you!', and fifteen percent were searching for muskets and/or pitchforks.&lt;br/&gt;
				Within eight hours of the traumatic end of the show, the hacker group Anonymous, and let's face it, our favorite people EVER, had, through semi-legal-ish 
				means, acquired the script for season 4. Analysts studying the script, which is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;,
				noted 'A shockingly high body count.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;*******************SPOILER ALERT**********************&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In the first episode, the family loses all their money in the economic crash of 1930. Tom Branson commits suicide in disgrace and the family is forced to 
				begin robbing banks to keep Downton afloat. In the second episode, a mad killer infiltrates the house and kills Lady Mary, James, and the dog from the 
				intro, before being killed by Thomas at the cost of his own life. The killer is unmasked and revealed to be the Dowager Countess Violet high on bath salts. 
				The season continues with approximately 1.7 deaths per episode (You may think this is an absurd example of the law of averages, but Daisy the kitchen maid 
				dies painfully over the course of two episodes.). In the end, the entire estate is burnt alive in the mansion, save O'Brian, everyone's least favorite 
				character, who, it turns out, is the one telling the story eighty years later. The season ends with a half-hour performance of 
				'&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izQsgE0L450&quot;&gt;Adagio for Strings&lt;/a&gt;', concluding with the entire orchestra dying of simultaneous heart attacks.

		<Title>RSHN Anchor Falls Asleep During Broadcast</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Students were shocked and horrified today when Rockettopia High School News' main anchor fell asleep halfway through his broadcast. This is a real change, 
				as previously the drowsiness caused by RHSN had been limited to the viewers of the broadcast, with three-minute broadcasts often followed by necessary 
				ten-minute breaks for waking up the students.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				However, today's broadcast focusing on Philosophy Midterm Question Four Theory resulted in the anchor actually falling asleep halfway through saying, &quot;David 
				Schienfeld is the head of the philosophy department at RHS and h&lt;sub&gt;as spent four years in Tibet studying the art of writing the perfect question four on a 
				midter...&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;. However, many have praised the anchor for his exceptional endurance, as most of the school had not made it past three words.

		<Title>Detective Club 'Confused' by Mysterious Posters</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Unfortunately, even Rockettopia High's best sleuths were unable to interpret the enigmatic posters that appeared across Rockettopia High School this week.
				The posters, which are small and uninteresting enough to be ignored by most, feature a picture of something, no one's sure what, and some text giving a
				general description of the event. The majority opinion is that the picture is probably of Africa, but a significant minority believes that it is a 
				poorly-drawn octopus. The text explains that there is a bake sale on February 15th. The words 'World Challenge 2014' also appear on the poster, although 
				there is no context. The poster fails to identify the club holding the bake sale or what the sale is funding.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When confused students Googled the phrase 'World Challenge 2014', the results failed satisfy questions, all that could be discovered is that it is some 
				sort of charity thing. The only response left was to call in the Detective Club. After hours of searching, the Detective Club came to the conclusion that 
				the posters may be the work of the Global Action Club, or GAC. The GAC is a club devoted to action on global issues. Their inconveniently-timed meetings 
				at five AM on Mondays are spent either making poorly-spelled posters about global issues for students to ignore and griping about how the community service 
				requirement is WAAAY too high.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Global Action Club could not be reached for comment.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In unrelated news, a poll by the Political Club showed that a majority of RHS students are not amused by humor involving the State of the Union Address, and, 
				in fact, have no idea what said address is. 60% of students thought it was where people send their letters to congress.

		<Title>Instead of Kim Kardashian, RHS Pop Culture Club Accidentally Books Kim Jong-Un for Seminar; Surprised to get Someone so Intelligent and Popular</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

			&lt;p&gt;
				After a startling booking mistake last Friday, the RHS Pop Culture Club accidentally booked North Korean Dictator and possible psychopath Kim Jong-un to 
				speak instead of American pointless celebrity and possible psychopath Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian, who along with her sisters Khloe and Kourtney are 
				the stars of reality TV shows and nearly inspired the Ku Klux Klan to change it's name for PR reasons, was supposed to be a speaker at a meeting of the 
				Rockettopia Pop Culture Club.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The most popular celerity in his country, Kim Jong-un is known for recently calling the United States his nation's 'worst enemy', smoking a cigarette 
				during a visit to a hospital, and showing compassion to his people by giving every child in his country a kilogram of candy to celebrate his birthday. 
				Needless to say, when took the podium in front of an audience expecting a Kardashian, he got a standing ovation.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Kim Jong-un then proceeded to speak about how he had avoided the obesity epidemic that plagues America in North Korea by outlawing food, his archaeological 
				discovery of the ancient Korean unicorn lair, and how his nation's tumbling-out-of-control satellite had already destroyed four GPS satellites, two weather 
				satellites  a communications satellite, the only toilet on the ISS, something that the CIA denies ever existed, and Iran's first astro-monkey.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				He wrapped up the speech by talking about how much he had enjoyed Rockettopia, and how it is now last on his list of American towns to nuke. He then received 
				another standing ovation, this one lasting thirty minutes. An audience member later admitted, &quot;It's not that his speech was particularly good, but that it 
				was so much better than what I had expected.&quot;.

		<Title>Locker Fire Caused By Joint thrown by Unaccounted-for Pocketknife-carrying Student into Unused Locker filled with Inappropriate Clothing</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Sources close to the principal ('s cat) say that today's fire in Rockettopia High School was caused by an unaccounted-for, pocketknife-carrying student 
				throwing a joint in a locker full of inappropriate clothing. According to reports, the student had just taken an elevator up to the third floor, despite 
				lacking any sort of medical need, and was distracted while texting on his phone. The fire, which resulted in a complete evacuation of the school into 
				the freezing cold, enraged all students who did not have tests during that period.  The RHS Detective Club has sworn to find the perpetrator of the 
				incident and bring him to justice. When asked what they would define as justice, one detective answered, &quot;Standing outside in the blipping cold for ten 
				blipping minutes! After that kind of experience, he'll most likely join the clergy.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The principal has used the incident to call for enforcement of the dress code, which is currently not enforced in regions including... the entire school. 
				However, this announcement did have some unintended consequences, as today alone, five girls with skirts deemed 'too short' were found locked in the 
				janitor's closets. Thankfully, they were not otherwise harmed. Some clubs also called for new clothing-rules that, according to the Rockettopia High 
				School Civil Liberties Union, &quot;Make Sharia clothes look like Victoria's Secret.&quot; But, even they agree, it would be worth it to avoid ever having to go 
				in weather that cold again.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Although the Pocketknife-joint-elevator-phone-clothes story is nearly universally accepted by the school community at large, some clubs suspect that this 
				is not the whole story. Some religious clubs blamed the fire on Gay Marriage. The NRA Club President was quoted as saying: &quot;If someone in the area had 
				been carrying a gun, they could have shot that bastard before he had a chance to give us all frostbite.&quot; The Supply-side Economics club proposed solving 
				the problem by cutting taxes on the rich. When we sent a reporter to ask what that had to do with anything, and how that even works in a school environment 
				where there are no taxes, he reported that the Supply-Side Economics Club Spokesman pretended not to hear the question and just kept whistling until our 
				reporter left him alone.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Even though the name of the person responsible for the incident has not yet been disclosed, it has been leaked that he has already sold the movie rights.

		<Title>Goth vs. Goth Prank Goes Horribly Awry</Title>

				Blood was spilled yesterday after a Science Club prank introduced Rockettopia High School's Goths to actual Goths went horribly wrong. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;
				The Goths were a powerful Germanic tribe that played an important role in the destruction of the Roman Empire. Today's Goths are people, generally 
				young people, who generally, dress in black, wear chains, wear heavy make-up, and have tattoos.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Since the horrible incident yesterday, some staff and students have been able to piece together an account of what happened. The Science Club apparently 
				thought it would be funny to use the RHS Particle Accelerator to go get ancient Goths and introduce them to modern Goths. However, the two Goth groups 
				did not get along. Only minutes after they arrived, the Goths were sent running back to the Early Medieval Age, with both themselves and their pride 
				seriously injured. On the upside, the Archaeology Club now has an abundance of artifacts to investigate.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Following the incident, the Science Club was banned from using the Particle Accelerator for two months.

		<Title>Lance Armstrong Apologizes for Doping; "I would never have done it if I had known I would be caught"</Title>

				As expected, Lance Armstrong confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs in his interview with Oprah Winfrey. In his own words, &quot;I made a terrible 
				mistake by using drugs to enhance my performance. I mean, not the same way Viagra does. A different kind of performance. Aww, hell! I realize now I 
				made a terrible mistake and ruined what could have been a great career. I swear, I never would have done it if I realized I'd be caught! I mistakenly 
				believed that even if I was incredibly good at biking, as long as I vigorously denied my crimes, I would never found out, and what the world doesn't 
				know won't hurt them, ya know? I became an idol to the world because I used these drugs, but I ruined it all by using these drugs.&quot; Some in the media 
				have called Armstrong's confession &quot;unrepentant&quot;(Sports Illustrated), &quot;morally deficient&quot;(ABC), &quot;horrifyingly soulless&quot;(ESPN), &quot;Hey! Look at this cool 
				touch-screen!&quot;(CNN), and &quot;f**king stupid&quot;(Jon Stewart). However, we at News from Rockettopia still point out that, well, it's still a step up from 
				every politician ever.

		<Title>Baboons Object to Being Compared to Congress</Title>

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In response to a spreading rumor that a collection of Baboons is correctly called a congress, the BaboUN, the spokesgroup for Baboons as a species, 
				issued a statement condemning the concept.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;&quot;A group of Baboons is correctly called a 'troop', not a 'congress' [Source: Politfact]&lt;/span&gt;. But that is beside the point. 
				Our real issue is the insulting comparison that has been drawn between ourselves and the United States Government. While we Baboons are well known 
				for biting one another, howling at one another, and extreme feats of mysogeny, our species has never done anything to deserve the offensive label of 
				'congress'. Sure, we have our issues; everyone does! But just try to find a record of a Baboon &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;tweeting his crotch to a woman 
				across the country, or fillibustering his own bill, or claiming rape is the will of God, or listening to Paul Ryan&lt;/span&gt;. We are a distinguished 
				species, and we will not tolorate this comparison. Please retract these statements, or we be will be forced to unleash upon you a devastating barrage 
				of s**t, which, remember, is still cleaner than most of what congress says. And remember, unlike Congress, we are working to improve our reputation.&quot;

		<Title>Representative Bill Stoner: "I will vote to confirm Chuck Yeager only if Obama Admits he was Born in Lasagna"</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Rockettopia's representative to Congress in Washington DC said that he would &quot;Vote to confirm Chuck Yeager only if President Obama admits he was born 
				in Lasagna.&quot; Critics pointed out that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;it was Chuck Hagel, a former Nebraska Senator, not Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly faster 
				than sound, who was president Obama's nominee, and that Lasagna is a dish and not a location&lt;/span&gt; (Did you mean 
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya&quot;&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;?). Representative Stoner was unavailable for comment.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In other news, the Representative's office stated that he was firmly and unconditionally opposed to the bill put forward by President Obama to ban all 
				firearms, which critics pointed out was unnecessary as no such bill exists, and denied a rumor that the Congressman had engaged in an extramarital 
				affair.

			&lt;p&gt;
				Last Friday, Politico reports, House Speaker John Boehner told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to, in his own words, &quot;Go f**k yourself&quot;. Reid had 
				publicly accused Boehner of running a 'dictatorship' in the House in order to hold onto his post as Speaker. Nevertheless, when Boehner instructed Reid
				to f**k himself, Reid replied with a surprised &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;. To this, Boehner repeated, &quot;Go f**k yourself.&quot; Boehner was later (We're 
				not making this up) seen bragging about the incident to his fellow &lt;s&gt;teenagers&lt;/s&gt; Republicans.

				The Philosophy club has embarked on a campaign to make sure no one utters the phrase: &quot;At least the next year couldn't be as weird as the last o- 
				OW! That was unnecessary!&quot; The club warns that suggesting that the bizarre and in some cases unessential events of the past year, such as the Aurora
				Shootings, the Newtown Shootings, the Oak Creek Shootings, the Clackamas Shooting, the Benghazi Attack, and Rick Santorum, could not be surpassed this 
				year would be &quot;Tempting luck&quot; and &quot;Not worth the risk&quot;. A leader of the club elaborated: &quot;We're undecided about whether such statements actually effect 
				the events that will unfold, but we're in agreement that it's definitely not worth taking that chance. I'm not sure the world could handle the kind of 
				craziness we saw in 2012 for another year. At least there's no election!&quot;

		<Title>Americans Reporting Physical Revulsion to the Phrase "Fiscal Cliff"</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Politics</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Over the last few weeks, reports have been coming in from the nation's doctors that the American public has grown so fed-up with the constantly-used 
				catch-phrase 'Fiscal Cliff-
				*ugh* &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.musculaction.com/forum/images/smilies/vomit-smiley-001.gif&quot;/&gt;
				-that any use of the phrase leads to a physical reaction. Reactions can range from mere nausea and headaches to vomiting, fever, organ failure, heart 
				palpitations. Some reports have shown another symptom, buying massive amounts of gold and guns, but that seems to only apply to Fox News Viewers. Doctors 
				have termed the unpleasant reaction of many to the phrase &quot;PQEIC&quot;, which stands for &quot;Political Quagmire Extreme Irritation Syndrome&quot;. The worst reported 
				case of this so far was when CNN did a segment on the Fiscal Cliff (*gag*&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.musculaction.com/forum/images/smilies/vomit-smiley-001.gif&quot;/&gt;) from 7:00 to 
				8:00 Saturday night, which experts estimate easily resulted in more emergency room visits than hurricanes Katrina and Sandy combined.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Earlier Saturday, Steve Doocy vomited live on a Fox &amp;amp; Friends segment about the Fiscal Cliff(*ack*&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.musculaction.com/forum/images/smilies/vomit-smiley-001.gif&quot;/&gt;),
				but many doctors claim this may have been simply because he was sitting next to Gretchen Carlson and Brian Kilmeade.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				To avoid exposure to news about the Fis- You Know What, the Surgeon General has recommended that all Americans avoid contact with Television, Radio, 
				Computers, Newspapers, and Anything Outside Their Homes. The Surgeon General Added that, &quot;Either way, this will be over in two days. If we don't go 
				over the you-know-what, this will all nothing but a bad memory. If we do go over, we as a country will have much more important things to worry 
				about.&quot;

		<Title>Wicca Club: Our activities on the Solstice definitely had nothing to do with Summoning Demons</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				As the investigation into the Wicca club continues, the club issued a statement denying the rumors that the club's strange activities on the solstice six 
				days ago. The club claims that the construction of a fifty foot pentagram on the football field, centered on a pit containing a dead squirrel, with cloaked, 
				muttering virgins at each of the five points, was &quot;In no way an attempt to invoke supernatural powers and summon demons from the underworld. The ritual was 
				simply a Wiccan tradition that carries no magical meaning.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The denial puzzled many people, as there are no accounts of anyone saying that the Wicca club was summoning demons prior to the announcement. There have, 
				however, been rumors that the Rockettopia School Board is considering forcing the disbanding of the Wicca Club. However, as a School Board official who 
				declined to be named pointed out, &quot;The Supreme Court says the Westboro Baptist Church and the Church of Scientology are legitimate religious groups. By 
				this definition, the KKK, the American Nazi Party, or anyone else who claims they are a religious group, are a religious group. The Wicca Club is definitely 
				a legitimate religious group, regardless of weather they are summoning demons. If we ban them from practicing their religion, we'll have the ACLU to deal 
				with.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Zombie Club warned that the summoning of demons was &quot;Dangerously close to the summoning of undead, which is our exclusive territory.&quot;

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				This is breaking news via CNN! A dog in Ohio has been reported to be acting strangely! At around ten AM today, the dog, a Pomeranian named Muffin, began 
				to run in circles around trees and cringe at the sight of cats, squirrels, and cars. The dog's owner, who declined to be named, told Shepard Smith that 
				she had &quot;Never seen Muffin acting like this since last mon-&quot;, but was cut off before she could finish.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				On Anderson Cooper 360, internationally renowned new age mystic Peace Ohwagher stated that the dog was foretelling the end of the world, as the Mayans 
				predicted. However, at one thirty-seven the dog abruptly began acting normally again. Psychics are currently debating what this means. Meanwhile, Wolf 
				Blitzer is rushing to Washington D.C, where someone claims to have seen a moderate Republican. We here at News from Rockettopia are skeptical.

		<Title>The Mayan Apocalypse PROPERLY Explained</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			Okay, we here at News from Rockettopia have to apologize for out interview with the Existential Club, which we sorta screwed up. Here to give us the truth 
			about the Mayan Apocalypse is someone who is undoubtedly an expert on Mayan culture, possibly the world's greatest expert, an actual Ancient Maya Ghost! 
			Our thanks to our volunteer, who wishes to remain anonymous, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting_in_Mesoamerica&quot;&gt;who stuck a stingray spine through his tongue and used it to pull a string of briars through, 
			providing the blood we needed to make the ghost appear.&lt;/a&gt;; Unfortunately, the ghost does not speak English, so we found a nearby Maya speaker. 
			However, she speaks Maya and Spanish only, so we got the first Spanish speaker we could find to translate (What can we say? We're in a hurry!).&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Interviewer&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;In the recent days, we've been hearing a lot about the so called 'Mayan Apocalypse'. A lot of people believe you 
			said the world would end on December 21st 2012. However, people who know what they're talking about say that this is a load of nonsense.&lt;/span&gt; What can 
			you tell us about it?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Transalator #1&lt;/b&gt;: En los últimos días, hemos estado escuchando mucho acerca de la llamada "Apocalipsis maya". Mucha gente cree que usted dijo que el 
			mundo se acabaría el 21 de diciembre de 2012. Sin embargo, las personas que saben lo que están hablando de decir que esto es un montón de tonterías. ¿Qué 
			nos puede decir al respecto?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Transalator #2&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/mayan_apocalypse/maya1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Ghost&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/mayan_apocalypse/maya2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Translator 2&lt;/b&gt;: ¿Qué? Nunca hemos dicho que el mundo se acaba, y mezclar cerveza con harina de maíz y agua salada repelente!&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Interviewer&lt;/b&gt;: Then what did you say would happen on December 21st 2012?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Ghost (Via translators)&lt;/b&gt;: We want to remember things, and it's reassuring to think that I still remember it.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Interviewer&lt;/b&gt;: So nothing will happen on December 21st?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Ghost (Via translators)&lt;/b&gt;: Well, will be the next solstice and began b'ak'tun, which is cause for great celebration, but much more. I guess you can 
			specify a range of ball games and human sacrifice?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Interviewer&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, it was nice speaking to you. Thank for helping us!&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Ghost (Via translators)&lt;/b&gt;: As attractive as you look, it is not acceptable to engage in such acts in public in my culture.&lt;br/&gt; 
			&lt;br/&gt;
			There you have it! The world will not be ending! Which we knew already.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Guys, she's bleeding again! Someone call 911!&lt;br/&gt;

			Most of you probably know that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;many people believe the world will end tomorrow, December 21st 2012&lt;/span&gt;. Some people have been 
			hoarding guns and hiding in bomb shelters. Most disturbingly,  &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;thousands of new agers have congregated at the tiny (pop. ~200) French 
			village of Bugarach, which many people believe is the place where alien spaceships will arrive to save us.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Here at News from Rockettopia, 
			we decided to try to find believers to explain the Mayan Long Count to us. The only people willing to talk to us were the members of the Existential Club.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Reporter&lt;/b&gt;: Hello! Please tell us a little about yourself and the Existential Club.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Jim&lt;/b&gt;: Hey dude. We're the dudes who sit around and contemplate the mysteries of the universe while all you people go on with your little day-to-day stuff. We're 
			this close to getting it, man!&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Reporter&lt;/b&gt;: Before we continue, there's something I think we need to clear up. A lot of people [Everyone we talked to] said that the Existential Club is really 
			about sitting around doing drugs. Is that true?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Jim&lt;/b&gt;: No, dude, that's like, waaay off base! Our club is about finding the meaning of life, not about doing marijuana. Or cocaine. Or heroin. Or opium. Or peyote. 
			Or LSD. Or Meth. Or bath salts. Or toads. Or those funny beetles we found yesterday that make your tongue feel like it's having se... [He continues like this 
			for some time]&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Reporter&lt;/b&gt;: I'm sorry for the confusion, but some people pointed out that there's also a Philosophy club, and they meet in a classroom while you meet in a shed. But 
			I didn't come to talk about you, although I'm sure you're very interesting. We want to know about the Mayan Apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Jim&lt;/b&gt;: Oh, total downer! Tomorrow is the day the Mayans predicted the world would end! See, a big giant comet is gonna smash the dark side of the moon, which makes 
			the moon come closer to earth, because, ya know, physics stuff, dude. So the moon pulls on the ocean, makes the ocean rise up and drown all the continents! It's 
			really a shame, dude, because the earth is so awesome, man! We're gonna have a huuuge meeting at Dave's house tonight to try to find the meaning of life before 
			it's too late! If you wanna come, dude, there's plenty of snacks for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt;: Hey! Mister reporter dude! Jim's a great dude but he's waaay off with this one! The alien battlefleets from the planets Zik and Wagar will collide at earth 
			and anhi-... anni... you know, wipe out each other and the entire solar system! See what war does to people?&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Dave&lt;/b&gt;: No, I read on the interwebs that the entire earth's gonna flip upside-down and the people won't be used to it so we'll all fall off!&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Sara&lt;/b&gt;: You dudes are sooooo wrong! It's the Dinosaurs! After like, a million years or something, they are coming out of hibernation to take back the world!&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Bill&lt;/b&gt;: No, I heard on the history channel...&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Reporter&lt;/b&gt;: I'll just go now...&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			So that settles it. It's either a comet hitting the moon, an alien space battle, the earth flipping upside-down, the return of the dinosaurs, or something else. 
			Good luck surviving.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			For those of you who want to know more about the imminent non-apocalypse, here are some good sources:

		<Text>
			As many of you already know, &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;some people believe that the world will end this Friday&lt;/span&gt;. Here are some things to expect relating to this.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			In the next four days: Nonstop History Channel end-of-the-world specials. They know that, one way or another, this market is not going to last long.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			On December 21st: Nonstop 24-hour news coverage of every little event that might possibly have something to do with the apocalypse. People doing things 
			that they always wanted to do but knew they'd regret.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Moments before midnight, December 21st: A massive crash in Apocalypse stock. Also a big crash in the Mayan Calendar industry.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			December 22nd: A lot of people doing emergency Christmas shopping. Also a lot of I-told-you-sos. People regretting the things they did yesterday when they 
			thought the world would end. People burning their Mayan calendars, lawn signs, and bumper stickers. Maybe even a few tattoo removals. All this is assuming 
			we're still here, of course.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			January 1st: &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The fiscal cliff&lt;/span&gt;. You know, the actual end of the world.

		<Title>NRA: Democrats "Might use this as an excuse to save our children"</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Text>
			&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Warning: This article is unusually venomous. It's just that all those dead children was kind of upsetting.&lt;/span&gt;
			A spokesman for the National Rifle Association responded today to the &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;horrific mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut&lt;/span&gt;,
			with a warning: &quot;This is a tragedy; Obama and the Democrats might use this as an excuse to save our children.&quot; &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The terrible 
			shooting, which took place on Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School, killed 27 people, 20 of them children. Democrats and gun legislation advocates 
			have since begun pressing for legislation that would stop these kinds of horrors.&lt;/span&gt; The NRA, however, has pushed back hard. Here is a full 
			transcript of the spokesman's speech:&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;You all are by now aware of the incident that took place in Newtown on Friday. A mentally unstable man shot his mother with her own assault 
				rifle, then traveled to a school and killed 26 more people, 20 of them children. This is a tragedy; Obama and the Democrats might use this 
				as an excuse to save our children.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
				&quot;This incident, along with others recently such as the one in Aurora, the shopping mall, the NFL, and the Sikh temple, has given the anti-American 
				evildoers who want to prevent such things an excuse to press their nonviolent rhetoric. Obama has never threatened to pass any sort of gun control 
				or passed any gun control. Now that he has won a second term, he may carry out the promises that he did not make! We must stall any sort of legislation 
				until America once again forgets the shock of the news of another mass shooting. We MUST live in a nation where Americans never have to go through 
				the shock and soul-searching that happens after a shooting. Because...  in our ideal nation...  this is nothing unusual.&lt;br/&gt;
				The fact that Adam Lanza was able to easily acquire an assault rifle without going through any sort of security check highlights a painful truth: 
				We need more gun freedom. Until every American can get a full-sized machine gun out of a vending machine in a gas station so they can quickly 
				respond to a threat, we are not safe. Until every elementary school child has a gun they are trained to use and to carry at all times, we are not 
				safe. Only hours before Lanza started his attack and a world away, a man in China also attacked a school. However, since due to China's strict 
				gun laws, he did not have a gun, all 22 of his victims are still alive. We must not become like China! We are America! Remember, American 
				exceptionalism! We have a nation that has eight times the gun violence of other industrialized nations! We must never give up our freedom to 
				watch our children DIE!&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			In all likelihood, he would have continued, but at this point the speaker fell over with a bullet in his head.&lt;br/&gt;

		<Title>North Korea Launches Satellites, Newscasters Declare: "This means ANYTHING is possible"</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>Global</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;This Wednesday, North Korea announced that they had successfully launched a satellite into orbit.&lt;/span&gt; News anchors and pundits 
				took this in stride, making jokes and generally taking the announcement with a grain of salt. But then a report came out that stunned the world into 
				a shocked and horrified silence: the reports of the satellite launch might be true.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Further investigations showed that &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;North Korea had, in fact, launched a 3-stage rocket carrying a satellite into orbit. As North Korea's
				missile tests have barely cleared the country to crash into the ocean&lt;/span&gt;, the world took the news that the North Koreans had managed to pull 
				off a success in their ballistics program as a message that, in the words of CNN's Anderson Cooper: &quot;This means ANYTHING is possible!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Other newscasters and pundits jumped on board. ABC news announced that China had legalized unions and set a minimum wage. NBC told the world that the UN 
				nations had voted unanimously to forgive all the world's debt. MSNBC declared that unemployment was down to 3%, and FOX news presented a 3-hour expose 
				about the UN's plans to kidnap our children for their army and form a one-world government. With further investigation, News from Rockettopia found that 
				the latter of these represented no significant change. Weather forecasters are currently predicting 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; temperatures for Canada and 3 feet of snow in Rio 
				de Janeiro. One particularly optimistic forecaster predicted a rain of kittens and bolts of silk in Nevada. A less ambitious forecaster predicted a rain 
				in Nevada.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Reporters stopped short, however, at predicting an agreement in Washington. As CNN's Shepard Smith put it: &quot;You can only go so far with this.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;hr/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				UPDATE: &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;A new report showed that the Korean Satellite might have an irregular and out-of-control orbit. The North Korean Government has 
				denied this claim.&lt;/span&gt; Finally, some semblance of reality has been restored.
			&lt;/p&gt;

		<Title>Psy Apologises for 2004 Song Praising the Killing of US Troops: "I never thought anyone would ever know or care"</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the hit K-Pop singer and creator of 'Gangam Style' apologized for his 2004 song that praised the killing of American 
				soldiers in Iraq.&lt;/span&gt; In his words: &quot;I never thought anyone would know or care.&quot; &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;The song, titled &quot;Dear American&quot;, condemns 
				the Iraq war and has lyrics that read:
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
				&quot;&#51060;&#46972;&#53356; &#54252;&#47196;&#47484; &#44256;&#47928;&#54644; &#45828; &#50472;&#48156;&#50577;&#45380;&#45448;&#46308;&#44284;&#44256;&#47928; &#54616;&#46972;&#44256; &#49884;&#53416; &#44060; &#50472;&#48156; &#50577;&#45380;&#45448;&#46308;&#50640;&#46392;&#47000;&#48120; &#50528;&#48120; &#47728;&#45712;&#47532; &#50528;&#48708; &#53076;&#51137;&#51060; &#47784;&#46160; &#51453;&#50668;&#50500;&#51452; &#52380;&#52380;&#55176; &#51453;&#50668; &#44256;&#53685;&#49828;&#47101;&#44172; 
				&#51453;&#50668;&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			Which, transalated, reads:
			&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
				&quot;&#1587;&#1582;&#1610;&#1601; &#1578;&#1593;&#1584;&#1610;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1580;&#1606;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1575;&#1602;&#1610;&#1610;&#1606; &#1583;&#1575;&#1606; &#1608;&#1603;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1605;&#1580;&#1575;&#1604; &#1604;&#1604;&#1581;&#1583;&#1575;&#1574;&#1602;&lt;br/&gt;
				&#1608;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604; &#1605;&#1587;&#1578;&#1588;&#1575;&#1585; &#1604;&#1603; &#1588;&#1610;&#1578; &#1593;&#1604;&#1609; &#1603;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1605;&#1580;&#1575;&#1604; &#1604;&#1604;&#1581;&#1583;&#1575;&#1574;&#1602;&lt;br/&gt;
				&#1575;&#1604;&#1591;&#1601;&#1604; &#1575;&#1610;&#1605;&#1610; &#1575;&#1576;&#1606;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1575;&#1606;&#1608;&#1606; &#1570;&#1576;&#1610; Ofay &#1602;&#1578;&#1604;&lt;br/&gt;
				&#1602;&#1578;&#1604; &#1576;&#1576;&#1591;&#1569; &#1580;&#1583;&#1575; &#1604;&#1607; &#1605;&#1593;&#1575;&#1606;&#1575;&#1577;.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			Which, in English, reads:
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
				&quot;F**king torturing Iraqi prisoners Dan and the amount of room for gardeners&lt;br /&gt;
				Advisor told you to S**t on the amount of room for gardeners&lt;br /&gt;
				Baby Amy daughter-in-law Abby Ofay kill&lt;br /&gt;
				Very slowly killing him suffer.&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			(God, translating programs are bad!)&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Which, when translated by a human into English, reads, roughly:&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
				&quot;Kill those **** Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives&lt;br /&gt;
				Kill those **** Yankees who ordered them to torture&lt;br /&gt;
				Kill their daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law, and fathers&lt;br /&gt;
				Kill them all slowly and painfully&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
				All the **** Yankees torturing Iraqis&lt;br /&gt;
				All those **** Yankees who ordered the torturing&lt;br /&gt;
				Kill their daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers&lt;br /&gt;
				Kill them very slowly and painfully.&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/11/controversy-over-psys-anti-american-lyrics-might-be-based-on-shoddy-translation/&quot;&gt;
			Or maybe something else that sounds similar and might have a completely different meaning:&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
				&quot;The **** despicable Western women and men who tortured Iraqi war prisoners and&lt;br /&gt;
				Dog **** despicable Western women and men who gave orders to torture&lt;br /&gt;
				Their daughter, mother, daughter-in-law, father the big-nose, kill all&lt;br /&gt;
				Very slowly kill, painfully kill.&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Ok, screw translation. Back to the topic. Psy argued that the song was excusable because at the time, as he said, &quot;I never even imagined 
				a situation in which anyone would remember, know, or care about this cover of another band's song that I did.&quot; Some people have criticized this 
				statement, arguing that it was not a real apology. Others have argued that this is a good thing, as that makes this statement more honest than 
				every apology given by a politician since Oog claimed that he had no knowledge about whether the cave-painting of a loincloth that appeared on 
				his wall was of him or not.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney expressed sympathy with Psy, stating, &quot;The exact same thing happened to me!&quot;

		<Title>Obama says America 'Might Leave Afghanistan Someday'</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				In a press conference yesterday, president Obama announced that he has plans to 'Maybe leave Afghanistan someday.'. American troops have been in 
				Afghanistan for over ten years, and the region is as unstable as ever. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Obama plans to withdraw from Afghanistan by 2014, unless 
				it is necessary to stay longer, which looks increasingly likely. America will withdraw from Afghanistan when the Afghan military is capable of 
				fighting the Taliban on its own. However, after this year's surge of attacks on Americans by Afghan troops, some wonder if the Taliban are the ones 
				who the Afghan army wants to fight.&lt;/span&gt; Many experts believed that America would have a military presence in Afghanistan until the sun goes out 
				in approximately 5 Billion Years, but Obama's announcement of a 'Someday' withdrawal date has some experts daring to hope that America will leave 
				by 2143. &quot;It's still a while&quot;, one expert quipped, &quot;but it's a huge improvement on before.&quot;.

		<Title>Rockettopia to Send Washington D.C. Emergency Shipment of Preschool Teachers</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>Politics</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				As the the gridlock in Washington D.C. is beginning to seem like it might ease, as was once thought impossible, the Rockettopia Town Council yesterday 
				decided to do it's patriotic duty and approved an emergency shipment of preschool teachers to help congress work out a compromise.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				When asked about this decision, the head of the town council remarked, &quot;I've had this idea for a while now, but the teachers always said that when a a 
				toddler is throwing a tantrum, it's impossible to reason with them, and the same can be said for congress. But now that congress is feeling like it can 
				talk about the problem, we hope that our best preschool teachers will be able to help them work out an agreement.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				After the announcement about the emergency shipment was made, I caught up with a member of the crack team of preschool teachers who will be sent on the 
				mission. She asked that her name not be released, but was willing to talk. &quot;I'm honored by being chosen for this assignment, and I expect that we will 
				be able to make some progress with Congress, even if they are more temperamental than any toddler I've ever dealt with. It will be hard work, but sooner 
				or later the top legislative body in the country will understand that to work together, both sides have to give up a little to get a little.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Senate minority Mitch McConnell responded to the teachers by speaking to congress about the dangers of public education, but the teachers remain optimistic 
				&quot;It's a once-in-a-lifetime challenge, but I think Congress will come around. Otherwise, God help us all.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Our dear friends at the Korean Central News Agency, the official news source of the 'Democratic People's Republic of [North] Korea' 
				yesterday reported that North Korean archaeologists had found the lair of the ancient King Tongmyong's Unicorn. The Lair of the Unicorn, which was 
				ridden by the founder of the ancient Koruryo kingdom, is apparently located in Pyongyang, proving that Pyongyang is the legitimate capitol of Korea. 
				But all anyone can talk about is the unicorn. &quot;Korea's history books deal with the unicorn, considered to be ridden by King Tongmyong, and its lair.&quot;, 
				remarked Jo Hui Sung, the head of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences' History Department. Unfortunately, the editors of News from Rockettopia suspect 
				that the international media, which is notoriously biased against the DPRK, will not take this important discovery seriously.

		<Title>"Breaking Dawn: Part 2" represents "Monumental Breakthrough" in Enhanced Interrogation Techniques</Title>
		<Authors>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Since the release of the much-anticipated film &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2&quot; a few weeks ago, the film has been praised by teenage girls and 
				condemned by just about everyone else. There is, however, an exception: The CIA. As a CIA administrator who declined to be named remarked: &quot;My daughter 
				begged me to let her go to this movie, but I had heard bad things about it, so I decided to see it myself first. After the first few minutes, I was clawing 
				at my eyes and waiting for death to take me. But then it hit This would be a great EIT!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				EITs, or &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Enhanced Interrogation Techniques  are modern forms of torture used by CIA agents at America's Guantanamo Bay facility to 
				extract information from suspected terrorists&lt;/span&gt;. The Idea of using Twilight to get people to talk quickly gained popularity among the CIA. The 
				president of the United States Government's Guantanamo Military Commission, which oversees the Guantanamo Prison, commented: &quot;These people are hardened 
				criminals. They can handle having water poured up their noses or being deprived of sleep for days on end, but no man, no matter how strong, can stand 2 
				hours of sparkling vampire romance.&quot; The initial trials are going well. As another CIA agent commented: &quot;There was this guy, Mahmoud, who we just couldn't 
				get to talk. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;We tried everything: Waterboarding, Sleep deprivation, shouting,&lt;/span&gt; but nothing seemed to work. Then we set him up 
				in the 'Vampire Room' and in fifteen minutes he was spilling his guts. The information gained from Mahmoud has resulted al Quada's number two man being 
				killed five times in two days, and...&quot; At this point, the agent trailed off, becoming increasingly concerned with the laser scope point on his head. Our 
				reporter decided it was time to go.

			Reality star &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Kim Kardashian, star of the hit reality show &lt;i&gt;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and four-time winner of coveted 
			the Dumbest Twitter Fad award, responded yesterday to &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;John Hamm's insult of her as a '[expletive] idiot'&lt;/span&gt; in a monosyllabic rant 
			incomprehensible to all listeners over the age of twenty-five. Her speech began with the phrase: &quot;You know how John Hamm called me an idi-ot yesterday? He 
			was, like, so, like, off base. I'm not an idi-ot. That's like, so, like, mean, like, like, like. Like. I'm not stu-pid, like, like, not at all. &quot; She went 
			on like this for a total of over thirty minutes, never using a word with more than one syllable. Kim Kardashian has since gained 100,000 new twitter 
			followers. &lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			In related news, the Rockettopia High detective club has traced the missing quarterback to the southwest united states, most likely in the legendary Mojave desert.

		<Text>
			In a strange turn of events this week, the Rockettopia High School football team quarterback was kidnapped by a giant robot helicopter. The quarterback was 
			taken by the helicopter in broad daylight and in view of twenty-six witnesses. Some have placed guilt on the Robotics Club for the kidnapping, due to the fact 
			that the club has been working on a secret project for the last two weeks and began the project after the Quarterback called them all 'Gay retards'. The robotics 
			club has issued a statement denying these claims. In related news, an anonymous student witnessed a discreet conversation between the Robotics Club and Psychology 
			Club presidents in which the witness discerned the words &quot;Brainwashing&quot;, &quot;Mojave Desert&quot;, and &quot;World's Best Realdoll&quot;. No-one has determined the meaning of these 
			words.&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			Whatever happens, we'll keep you posted right here!&lt;br/&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
				An ancient text, only recently translated from Latin, has proven once and for all that the original purpose of valentines day was much the same as today: To 
				make single people feel like crap. The history of Valentines day have been well known to archaeologists for a while, but this is the first text with 
				information on the origins.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;Valentines day was originally a Roman holiday, associated with Juno, goddess of Marriage (Hera to Greeks)(Why they didn't use 
				Venus(Aphrodite), goddess of love, is something I have never understood). Juno's holiday was similar to the Valentine's day of today. When the Christians 
				came to power in Rome, they changed all the Hellenistic holidays to Christian Holidays. The Spring Festival became Easter, The Solstace became Christmas, 
				etc. Juno's holiday was renamed Saint Valentine's Day, but stayed pretty much the same.&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The new text shows evidence of the very origin of Valentine's day. The text reads, roughly translated:&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				Antonius Suporius and his drunken buddies really liked to make fun of Marcus Thicaborus, so when he broke up with his girlfriend in February, 
				they vigorously made fun of him by loving (Latin word much ruder) their dates in full view of him. As this really pissed him off, they continued to do this 
				every year, even after he had a date, as theirs were always prettier. Years later, others took up the tradition of rubbing their dates in single people's 
				faces, sometimes more literally than others, and eventually this holiday became official and was named after the great goddess Juno. It really should have 
				been Venus.
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			Never call the modern Valentine's day practice of taunting single people nontraditional again!

		<Title>New England Refuses to Accept that Patriots Sucked</Title>

			&lt;p&gt;
				Over the last few days, New Englanders refused to accept that the patriots totally sucked at the super bowl. Many theories have condensed to explain 
				away the fact that the Patriots lost the Super Bowl by a staggering four points. The most common conspiracy states that the Giants kidnapped the 
				actual New England Patriots prior to the big game and replaced them with a team of robots. Although the robots were originally programmed to lose 
				by more points, the theorists say that not even robots could have lost to the NY Giants that badly.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Supply Side Economics Club is still going to do an article in the Cornpopper, which will be reprinted here. The Cornpopper staff have supposedly 
				attempted through every possible means to stop the article from being printed. In an unofficial statement, an unnamed editor said that the Supply Side 
				Economics Club article was &quot;So crazy it makes Newt Gingrich sound sane. It's like saying 'Screw the Poor' but meaning it. I must remember the yacht.&quot; 
				He is apparently referring to the three hundred foot yacht that was donated to the Cornpopper staff from an unknown source.

		<Title>Supply Side Economics Club Calls Obama Mars Conspiracy a Liberal Conspiracy</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>

		<Topic>Culture</Topic>
		<Text>
			The president of the supply side economics club stated this week that the &quot;Obama Mars Conspiracy Theory&quot; was a liberal conspiracy. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;
			The &quot;Obama Mars Conspiracy Theory&quot; states that president Barack Obama was part of a top-secret CIA mission to mars during the 1980s, during which he was 
			issued the warning: &quot;Simply put, your task is to be seen and not eaten.&quot;. The Obama Administration has come out and denied this claim. Yes, that's right, 
			the president has denies the perfectly ridiculous claim that he went to Mars to &quot;... acclimate Martian humanoids and animals to their presence...&quot; in the 
			1980s.&lt;/span&gt; The Supply Side Economics club has concluded that the only reason the Obama administration would deny this bull&amp;amp;#^&amp;amp; is if the 
			administration had planned the whole thing. The administration's plan, according to the Club, was to make all the other (True) Obama conspiracies, such as 
			the Birther, Muslim, Terrorist, Gay, etc. conspiracies, look silly. The Club's president justified this claim with the statement &quot;Liberals all have this weird 
			obsession with generalizations.&quot; The Club President then asked why everyone within hearing distance had collapsed laughing.

		<Title>Joe Paterno Dies, People Immedietly Forget What an Asshole He Was</Title>
		<Authors>

		<Topic>Sports</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;When Joe Paterno died on January 22nd, 2012, the entire world immediately forgot what an asshole he was. People gathered to praise Paterno, 
				instantly forgetting that he had been fired from Penn State only a few months before for covering up the fact that one of his assistants was a pedophile.&lt;/span&gt;
				As one Rockettopia football fan said, &quot;It's so sad that such a great man had to die so soon. At least he lived a blame-free life. He was always so kind and generous! 
				He would never let anyone, least of all a young person, come to harm. He...&quot; It is not known what the football fan said next, as at this point the reporter was 
				laughing so hard he could hardly breathe, let alone write.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The History club has pointed out that this has become a trend. Once someone dies, it becomes unacceptable to remind anyone of their many shortcomings. No one talks 
				about John F. Kennedy's playboy lifestyle, how he was constantly sneaking women into the White House under his wife's nose. If anyone so much as hinted at the fact 
				that Martin Luther King Jr. went to prostitutes, they would immediately be slammed as a racist. (Unless, of course, that person happened to be running for the
				Republican nomination, in which case the person who said it would become the frontrunner) The History club says that this is probably also true of Paterno.

			&lt;p&gt;
				Six students had to be hospitalized on Friday after a Math teacher asked &quot;You all seem to be talking about T-bows. Is that a World of Warcraft weapon or 
				something?&quot; Two students immediately began to vomit and three suffered heart attacks and had to be rushed to the emergency room. The worst case of all was 
				football fanatic Roy Smith who suffered a mental breakdown and is currently in the hospital and convinced that he is Blackbeard. We all hope for his 
				recovery.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				A World of Warcraft fan had this to say about the incident: &quot;Whatever a T-bow is, it's not anything in World of Warcraft. If it was, I'd have one.&quot;

			&lt;p&gt;
				In the spirit of the holidays, News from Rockettopia would like to wish you all a merry Christmas or happy Hanukkah! And if you haven't gotten a gift yet, don't worry, 
				our friends at We Are Toys are offering a special discount on everything! It's the time to save on obscenely extravagant gifts, like a phone so expensive it could feed 
				a starving African nation for a week! You could be saving lives, but that's not important. What's really important is buying the new iThing 4S, because having an old 
				iThing 4 is soooo uncool. But what's really cool is to indulge in ridiculously expensive gifts to help our super-rich get even richer! And don't think of all the starving 
				children who don't even have a loaf of bread for Christmas, because that's such a downer! As Jesus said:&lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&lt;s&gt;Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. (Luke 6:20)&lt;/s&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				I mean:
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&lt;s&gt;If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. (Matthew 19:21)&lt;/s&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Umm... I mean:
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&lt;s&gt;For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. (Luke 18:25)&lt;/s&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Errr...
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&lt;s&gt;But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will 
				be repaid at the resurrection of the just.&quot; (Luke 14:13-14)&lt;/s&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				STOP IT!! Anyway, JUST BUY USELESS SHIT, DAMMIT!

		<Title>New Religious Clubs introduced to Rockettopia High</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Today, the Principal of Rockettopia High School approved the formation of the school's first Religious Clubs. Reporter John Smith talked to the principal.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			John: &quot;So why are these clubs allowed?&lt;br/&gt;
			Principal: &quot;America gaurentees religious freedom for all, so these clubs must be allowed to form. Although they will be using school premises, they will not 
			have access to school funds, and will not give academic credit&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
			John: &quot;You mean sort of like the Dungeons and Dragons club?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
			Principal: &quot;Yes, exactly like the Dungeons and Dragons club.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Among the new religious clubs, one stands out: the Supply Side Economics Club. The Supply Side Economics club, believes that:&lt;br/&gt;
				1. There is an invisible hand that guides the free market;&lt;br/&gt;
				2. If we give rich people money and make them exempt from the laws, the invisible hand will be pleased, and the world will become a better place.&lt;br/&gt;
				Although these beliefs are thought to be bat%#&amp;amp; insane by most of the school, some have latched onto it, especially the richer students.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The race for the Cornpopper article is over! The Supply Side Economics club has won the space with a very large bid. According to some investigative reporters, 
				the Club was helped by the banking giant Chase. Although the sum of money paid to the Cornpopper for the space was not specified, a Cornpopper administrator 
				hinted that it might be more than the annual Gross Domestic Product of Rockettopia. These suspicions were reinforced with the installation of a NASA supercomputer 
				in the Technology Lab, the planned construction of a Particle Accelerator, and the principal's surprise purchase of a luxury yacht.

		<Title>Principal Returns from South Pacific Captivity Dressed as Hula Dancer, is Mistaken for Popular Girl</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Yesterday, the principal returned from his captivity in the South Pacific, having escaped disguised as a hula dancer, and was promptly mistaken for one of the 
				'Popular' girls. It has been confirmed by the Rockettopia High Newspaper, the Cornpopper, that at least five boys asked the principal out before he made it the 
				hundred feet between the door and his office. A member of the Psychology Club explained: &quot;He was wearing a grass skirt, coconuts on his chest, a headdress, 
				sandals, a ton of makeup, and nothing else. &lt;span name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;That is a bit more than most of the Popular girls wear&lt;/span&gt;, but the heterosexual wing of the 
				football team still found him hot enough to date. Well, it's true that he was sort of sexy in that tiny grass skirt, with those huge hips and tiny, adorable, 
				waist...&quot; The reporter left shortly after. (Later research confirmed that the interviewed Psychology club member was one of the five who asked out the principal.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In the Auction for space in the paper, the Psychology and Ecology clubs are still neck-and-neck, although there have been rumors that the Ecology club will drop it. 
				Competition has been getting fierce, with reports of Ecology Club members feeding Psychology Club members to Venus Flytraps. The Psychology club went one worse and 
				forcibly lectured three ecology club members on Freudian Psychology.

		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				The annual Rockettopia Thanksgiving Concert was an epic fail after an unknown party filled the chorus practice room with helium. Although there is no proof of 
				who is behind the caper, most students believe that the Strings have finally got their revenge. Some support for this theory comes from the fact that, although 
				the Strings have held a bake sale every Friday since the kidnapping of one of their own, they had not seemed to have spent the money. The fact that the string 
				orchestra record books are said to list 'Helium' as their highest expenditure is also a hint. The chorus has stated in a press release that they intend to get 
				revenge.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In unrelated news, the Aeronautics club has tracked the principal to a remote island in the pacific. The student council is trying to raise money for a rescue 
				mission. The balance of the 'Rescue the Principal' fund is currently at five cents.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In the auction for Cornpopper space, the Psychology and Ecology clubs are still neck-and-neck.

		<Title>D&amp;D Club Least Equipped to Handle Actual Troll</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				In a turn of events that surprised the entire Dungeons and Dragons Club, the D&amp;amp;D club was actually the least equipped student group to handle the troll that 
				rampaged through Rockettopia High School on Wednesday. Although the D&amp;amp;D club leader, a self described 'Level 14 Elf Wizard', tried using magic to stop the 
				rampaging beast, he was unsuccessful, determining that the troll 'Is under the influence of a level 15 anti-type-6C-magic-shield-spell.' In related news, 
				the D&amp;amp;D club has chosen a new leader.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The anti-cyberbullying club attempted to cure the troll's antisocial tendencies through compassion, and three of them were devoured before someone pointed out 
				that 'It's not that kind of troll.' The ecology club withdrew to their ecological complex (i.e. Classroom with a lot of plants) to attempt to find a natural control.
				After a few hours, the Robotics club defeated the troll with a giant killer robot. They said that they had not defeated the troll earlier because 'We thought it 
				might give us more respect than the student council. But the council's going to give us a grant now, right?' The correctness of this statement was emphasized by the 
				robot training a laser on the class president. We here at The Cornpopper hope that, in the words of the principal 'This damn school will stay quiet for a whi-' The 
				principal's remarks were cut short as he was kidnapped by harpies.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				To raise funds, The Cornpopper will be auctioning off a spot in an upcoming edition to the club that pays the most. The Psychology Club and the Ecology Club are 
				currently neck and neck for first.

		<Title>Student Sells Soul to Satan for CityCash</Title>
		<Authors>
			<Author>J.E.Ditor</Author>
		</Authors>
		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				Yesterday, an unnamed student leaked the news that another unnamed student had told her that her friend's boyfriend's best friend had sold
				his soul to Satan for 1,000 CityCash. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				CityCash, the form of currency in the popular Facebook game CityVille, has now become such an important part
				of the economy that 75% of stores now accept it as legal tender, and news networks issue daily updates on the strength of the CityDollar. &quot;Looking at
				these facts, it's inevitable that CityCash would become more valuable than the soul.&quot;, said the president of the Rockettopia High Economics Club. 
				&quot;I think we can expect to see a lot more of this in the future.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				According to the spokesperson for the Psycology club, the soul-less student, who now wanders the hall looking for brains and avoiding glee fans, originally 
				bargained for 10,000 CityCash, but was turned down by Satan, most likely because a soul is only worth so much, and Satan's city doesn't appear to be doing 
				very well. &quot;Anyway&quot;, said the spokesperson,&quot; this guy didn't have much of a soul. He was in the D&amp;amp;D club, and they're supposed to have an exclusive deal 
				with Boccob.&quot;

		<Title>Sex in Sectionals</Title>

		<Topic>High School</Topic>
		<Text>
			&lt;p&gt;
				This week, the shocking truth came out that students in the Rockettopia String orchestra were using their sectional time for, among other things,
				sex. An onlooker reported this:
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
				&quot;I was walking past one of the practice rooms when I saw a girl walking in. Then I heard a brief conversation,
				followed by giggling and a flow of students leaving the room. Then the giggling intensified, followed by kissing sounds, other sounds, and cries of 'Yes,
				yes, oh, oh, more, more, hehehe!' I then quietly walked away.&quot;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&quot;Despite the fact that the student only confided in his experience with a few close
				friends, the story quickly got around, resulting in the principal condemning the situation as 'Shocking!', the psychology club issuing a statement blaming
				the situation on the human instinct towards mindless sex. The Band also released a taped statement, &quot;These shocking revelations show how mindless the string
				orchestra can be at times. However, do not use this as an excuse to condemn the entire music department. These allegations do not apply to the band.&quot; The
				student body generally thinks this speech would be much more reassuring if not for the cries of 'Ooohhh! Ooohhh! Yes! More! Faster! Oh, oh, oh!' emanating
				from a nearby room. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				The Chrous also released a statement, albeit of a different tone than the Band's: &quot;Why is anyone shocked by this? Isn't this what
				sexionals is for? I mean, it's sexionals, right?&quot;

				The Rockettopia High GSA fell short on new recruits from the freshman class, mostly in the 'Gay' department. &quot;The GSA has more new straight members
				than ever&quot;, said a GSA member, &quot;But there are only a few Gay members.&quot; The GSA refused to speculate on the cause of the seeming shortage of gay freshmen,
				but the Psychology Club was less reserved. &quot;They've obviously all joined the football team&quot;, said the Psychology Club president, &quot;I mean, who could resist?
				The football team offers the ability to contort yourself into extremely sexual positions with other boys while seeming cool? It's too good to pass up! I
				mean, how many straight boys would sign up for a club if it involved getting intimately close to attractive girls without any embarrassment?&quot; The Psychology
				club president was now smiling and breathing heavily. &quot;I mean, like, you know, when a cigar isn't just a cigar!&quot; The reporter then ended the interview for
				reasons he called &quot;Obvious&quot;.

			&lt;p&gt;
				Yesterday, an unnamed strings player was found gagged, blindfolded, and stripped naked in the rain in Rockettopia Veteran's Field. The violinist
				was first found by the football team, but was not reported for over half an hour, while the football team argued about who got to move her off the field.
				The argument ended with police intervention, but not before three football players sustained severe injuries and had to be hospitalized. Although it is
				not known for sure who perpetrated this offense, many suspect that the chorus was at fault. &quot;The Chorus is barbaric&quot;, said one unnamed cellist, &quot;They'll
				stop at nothing to win this feud.&quot; However, when asked what winning the feud would entail, the cellist was unable to come up with an answer. A spokesman 
				for the string orchestra said that they would get back at the chorus, but did not elaborate on how.
